* Prologue
** About
   These are my notes of the twenty SICP lectures of June 1986,
   produced by Hewlett-Packard Television. These videos are available
   under a Creative Commons license.

   These notes aim to be concise and as example-heavy as possible. The
   language used and referred to as "Lisp" is MIT-Scheme. These notes,
   however, use the SICP language provided by Racket, a modern Scheme
   dialect. This is because Racket's integration with Emacs and Org
   mode is orders of magnitude better than MIT-Scheme's. In general,
   all "Lisp" code looks exactly the same as in SICP, with the
   exception of having to prefix some numbers with =#i= to ensure
   Racket treats them as imprecise.

   Note that Racket's SICP language creates mutable pairs (=mpair='s)
   by default, as in MIT Scheme. Therefore, =set-car!= and =set-cdr!=
   are available as primitives.

* Lecture 1A: Overview and Introduction to Lisp

  Computer science isn't really a science, and it isn't really about
  computers. Computer science is the study of how-to or imperative
  knowledge (as opposed to declarative knowledge). To illustrate the
  difference, consider:

  $$y = \sqrt{x} \mathrm{~such~that~} y^2=x, y \geq 0$$

  This is declarative, in that we could recognize if $y$ is the square
  root of $x$ given $x$ and $y$, but we're no closer to knowing how to
  /find/ $y$ if we are given $x$. Imperative knowledge would look
  like:

  To find the square root $y$ of $x$:
  - Make a guess $g$.
  - If $g^2$ is close enough to $x$, $y=g$.
  - Otherwise, make a new guess equal to the average of $g$ and $x/g$.

  This method will eventually come up with a $g$ close enough to the
  actual square root $y$ of $x$.

  Computer science focuses on this kind of imperative knowledge, and,
  specifically, how to communicate that knowledge to a computer.

** Managing Complexity: Key Ideas of 6.001
   Computer science is also about managing complexity, in that large
   programs that you can't hold in your head should still be manageable
   and easy to work with. We explore this theme in 6.001 by learning
   three key ideas:

   - Black-box abstractions
   - Conventional interfaces
   - Metalinguistic abstraction.


** Let's Learn Lisp
   When learning a new language, always ask about its:
   - Primitive elements,
   - Means of combination, and
   - Means of abstraction.

*** Primitive Elements
    These are numbers like 3, 17.4, or 5. Other primitives are
    discussed later in the course.

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      4
      17.4
      5
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 4
    : 17.4
    : 5

*** Means of Combination
    Lisp's numerical primitives can be combined with "operations" such
    as addition, written in prefix notation.

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (+ 3 17.4 5)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 25.4

    Other basic operations are provided by Lisp, such as
    multiplication and division. Of course, combinations can be
    combined recursively:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (+ 3 (* 5 6) 8 2)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 43

    This should show you the tree structure inherent in all of Lisp:
    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [+
    #+LATEX: [* [5] [6]] [8] [2]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}

    In Lisp, () is the application of an operation or function in
    prefix notation.

*** Means of Abstraction
    Abstraction can simply be done by naming things. Giving
    complicated things a name prevents us from having to understand
    how the thing the name refers to /works/, and instead lets us
    "abstractly" use the name for our purposes.

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define a (* 5 5))
      a
      (* a a)
      (define b (+ a (* 5 a)))
      b
      (+ a (/ b 5))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 25
    : 625
    : 150
    : 55

    Now, it's often more useful to abstract away imperative how-to
    knowledge. Consider:

    #+NAME: square
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (square x)
        (* x x))
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<square>>
      (square 10)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 100

    This defines =square= as a function taking a single argument =x=,
    and returning =(* x x)=. Note that this way of writing a define is
    actually "syntactic sugar" for:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define square
        (lambda (x)
          (* x x)))

      (square 25)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 625

    =lambda (x)= means "make a procedure that takes argument =x=". The
    second argument to lambda is the actual procedure body. The
    =define= names this anonymous procedure =square=.

    Just like we can use combinations recursively, so we can
    abstractions. Consider:

    #+NAME: average
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (average x y)
        (/ (+ x y) 2))
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<square>>
      <<average>>
      (define (mean-square x y)
        (average (square x)
                 (square y)))

      (mean-square 2 3)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 13/2

    Note the indentation: since Lisp is parenthesis heavy, we use
    indentation. Good editors like Emacs should do this automatically.

** Case Analysis in Lisp

   To represent functions like:
   $$abs(x) = \begin{cases}
   -x & x<0\\
   0 & x = 0\\
   x & x > 0
   \end{cases}$$
   Lisp needs some form of conditional execution. In Lisp, this
   function would look like:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (abs x)
       (cond ((< x 0) (- x))
             ((= x 0) 0)
             ((> x 0) x)))
     (abs -3)
     (abs 0)
     (abs 5)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
   : 0
   : 5

   =cond= takes any number of arguments. Each argument must be
   structured as =(predicate) (consequent)=. If =predicate= is true,
   we do the =consequent=. Otherwise, we don't. Lisp also provides a
   way to write conditionals that only have two branches (an if-else):

   #+NAME: abs
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (abs x)
       (if (< x 0)
           (- x)
           x))
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<abs>>
     (abs -11)
     (abs 0)
     (abs 33)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 11
   : 0
   : 33

   =cond= and =if= are syntactical sugar for each other. The Lisp
   implementation picks any one and defines the other in terms of it.

   We now know most of Lisp. Lisp doesn't have =do...while= or =for=,
   since anything a loop can do can be done via recursion.

** Finding Square Roots

   Remember our square root finding algorithm?

   To find the square root $y$ of $x$:
   - Make a guess $g$.
   - If $g^2$ is close enough to $x$, $y=g$.
   - Otherwise, make a new guess equal to the average of $g$ and
     $x/g$.

   Or, in Lisp,

   #+NAME: try
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (try g x)
       (if (good-enough? g x)
           g
           (try (improve g x) x)))
   #+END_SRC

   This is a form of programming called "wishful thinking": we assume
   =good-enough?= (good enough predicate) and =improve= are already
   implemented. Now that we can try a guess and improve it till it's
   good enough, we can write a simple square root function:

   #+NAME: sqrt
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (sqrt x)
       (try 1 x))
   #+END_SRC

   This function simply starts the guess at 1, then improves it. Let's
   now write the functions we don't have:

   #+NAME: improve
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (improve g x)
       (average g (/ x g)))
   #+END_SRC

   #+NAME: good-enough?
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (good-enough? g x)
       (< (abs (- (square g) x))
          0.00001))
   #+END_SRC

   This tests if $g^2$ is within 0.0001 of $x$. Putting it all
   together, we can finally try to find square roots:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<square>>
     <<average>>
     <<abs>>
     <<improve>>
     <<good-enough?>>
     <<try>>
     <<sqrt>>
     (sqrt #i2)
     (sqrt #i3)
     (sqrt #i4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1.4142156862745097
   : 1.7320508100147274
   : 2.0000000929222947

   #+begin_quote
   *Note:* The =#i4= is Racket's syntax for using imprecise
   (decimals) instead of precise (fractions). Ignore it, and treat it
   as the number =4=.
   #+end_quote

   See that =try= actually runs a loop, but does so recursively,
   calling itself every time the =if= condition fails to improve the
   guess. Also note that these functions can all be nested inside the
   square root function to hide them from the outer scope, thus:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (sqrt x)
       (define (good-enough? g)
         (define (square g)
           (* g g))
         (define (abs y)
           (if (< y 0)
               (- y)
               y))
         (< (abs (- (square g) x))
            0.0001))
       (define (improve g)
         (define (average y z)
           (/ (+ y z) 2))
         (average g (/ x g)))
       (define (try g)
         (if (good-enough? g)
             g
             (try (improve g))))
       (try 1))

     (sqrt #i2)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1.4142156862745097

   This program should also show you a tree-like dependency of the
   functions, with each function containing the definitions of the
   functions it depends on. For someone using =sqrt=, all the functions
   within it are hidden.

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{sqrt}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{try}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{good-enough?}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{abs}] [\texttt{square}]]
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{improve}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{average}]]
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{try}]]]
   #+LATEX: \end{forest}
   #+LATEX: \end{center}

   This discipline of writing procedures is called lexical scoping.


** Inbuilt/Primitive Procedures Aren't Special

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<square>>
     square
     +
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : #<procedure:square>
   : #<procedure:+>

* Lecture 1B: Procedures and Processes, Substitution Model

** Substitution Rule/Model
   The substitution rule states that,

   #+begin_quote
   To evaluate an application:
   - Evaluate the operator to get procedure.
   - Evaluate the operands to get arguments.
   - Apply procedure to arguments.
     - Copy body of procedure.
     - Replace formal parameters with actual arguments.
   - Evaluate new body.
   #+end_quote

   Note that this isn't necessarily how the /interpreter/ evaluates a
   Lisp application, but the substitution rule is a "good enough"
   model for our purposes.

*** Kinds of Expressions in Lisp
    - Numbers (evaluate to "themselves")
    - Symbols (represent some procedure)
    - Combinations
    - \lambda-expressions (used to build procedures)
    - Definitions (used to name symbols)
    - Conditionals

    We will focus our use of the substitution rule on the first three.
    The last three are called "special forms", and we'll worry about
    them later.

*** Example

    Consider:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<square>>
      (define (sum-of-squares x y)
        (+ (square x) (square y)))

      (sum-of-squares 3 4)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 25

    Let's try to apply the substitution rule to our application,

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (sum-of-squares 3 4)
      (+ (square 3) (square 4))
      (+ (square 3) (* 4 4))
      (+ (square 3) 16)
      (+ (* 3 3) 16)
      (+ 9 16)
      25
    #+END_SRC

** Peano Arithmetic

*** Simple Peano Addition
    Peano arithmetic defines addition as:

    #+NAME: peano-a
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      (define (pa+ x y)
        (if (= x 0)
            y
            (pa+ (dec x) (inc y))))
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<peano-a>>
      (pa+ 3 4)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 7

    Assume that =inc= and =dec= are primitives available that increment
    and decrement the argument respectively. How is the procedure =pa+=
    working? Let's apply the substitution rule.

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (pa+ 3 4)
      (if (= 3 0)
          4
          (pa+ (dec 3) (inc 4)))
      (pa+ 2 5)
      ...
      (pa+ 1 6)
      ...
      (pa+ 0 7)
      7
    #+END_SRC

    We're skipping some steps, but the idea is that =x= keeps giving
    one "unit" to =y= until it reaches zero. Then the sum is =y=.
    Written with steps skipped:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (pa+ 3 4)
      (pa+ 2 5)
      (pa+ 1 6)
      (pa+ 0 7)
      7
    #+END_SRC

*** Another Peano Adder
    Consider:
    #+NAME: peano-b
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      (define (pb+ x y)
        (if (= x 0)
            y
            (inc (pb+ (dec x) y))))
    #+END_SRC


    This is also a Peano adder: but it's implemented /slightly/
    differently syntax-wise, a few characters here and there. Let's
    use the substitution rule to see how it works.

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (pb+ 3 4)
      (inc (pb+ 2 4))
      (inc (inc (pb+ 1 4)))
      (inc (inc (inc (pb+ 0 4))))
      (inc (inc ((inc 4))))
      (inc (inc 5))
      (inc 6)
      7
    #+END_SRC

    See that it /does/ work:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<peano-b>>
      (pb+ 3 4)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 7

    Now, consider how these two, =pa+= and =pb+=, are different. While
    the /procedures/ do the same thing, the processes are wildly
    different. Let's discuss their time and space complexity.
    It should be obvious to you that the time complexity is the
    vertical axis in the substitution rule application, since the
    interpreter "executes" these instructions line by line. More lines
    means more time.

    In the case of =pa+=, the number of lines increases by 1 if you
    increase input =x= by 1. Thus, the time complexity is $O(x)$.
    Similarly, in the case of =pb+=, the number of lines increases by
    2 (once in the expansion, once in the contraction) when you
    increase =x= by 1. Thus, it is also $O(x)$.

    Now, the horizontal axis shows us how much space is being used. In
    the case of =pa+=, the space used is a constant. Thus, $O(1)$. On
    the other hand, see that =pb+= first /expands/ then /contracts/.
    The length of the maximum expansion increases by 1 if we increase
    $x$ by 1, since there's one more increment to do. Thus, $O(x)$.

    Now, we call a process like =pa+= /linear iterative/ and a process
    like =pb+= /linear recursive/.

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t :align lccl
    | Process | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Type             |
    |---------+-----------------+------------------+------------------|
    | =pa+=   | $O(x)$          | $O(1)$           | Linear iterative |
    | =pb+=   | $O(x)$          | $O(x)$           | Linear recursive |

    Note that the /process/ =pa+= being iterative has nothing to do
    with the implementation/definition of the /procedure/, which is
    recursive. Iteration refers to the constant space requirement.

** Differentiating Between Iterative and Recursive Processes

   One of the primary ways to differentiate between an iterative and
   recursive process is to imagine what'd happen if you turned the
   computer off, then resumed the current computation.

   In a recursive process, we've lost some important information: how
   deep into the recursion we are. In the =pb+= example, we wouldn't
   know how many =inc='s deep we are (information stored in the RAM by
   the interpreter, not by the process), meaning that we can't return
   the right value.

   In an iterative process, we can pick up right where we left off,
   since /all/ state information is contained by the process.

** Fibonacci Numbers

   Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

   $$F(x) =
   \begin{cases}
   0, & x = 0\\
   1, & x = 1\\
   F(x-1) + F(x-2), & \mathrm{otherwise}
   \end{cases}$$

   The series itself is:
   $$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55\dots$$

   Let's write a Lisp function to calculate the $n\mathrm{th}$ Fibonacci
   number, assuming 0 is the 0th.

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (fib n)
       (if (< n 2)
           n
           (+ (fib (- n 1))
              (fib (- n 2)))))
     (fib 10)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 55

   It works, that's true. But how /well/ does it work. Let's see. When
   we call (say) =(fib 4)=, we also call =(fib 3)= and =(fib 2)=, both
   of which also call $\dots$ let's draw it:

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{(fib 4)}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{(fib 3)}
   #+LATEX: [\texttt{(fib 2)} [\texttt{(fib 1)} [1]] [\texttt{(fib 0)} [0]]]

   A tree! Clearly, this is an exponential-time process, since
   computing $n+1$ takes exponentially more effort. Also note that
   it's a pretty bad process, since we constantly recompute many
   values. The space complexity is the maximum depth of the tree
   (depth of recursion), which is at most $n$. Therefore, the time
   complexity is $O(\mathrm{fib}(n))$ and space complexity is $O(n)$.

   It is useful to try and write an iterative Fibonacci with better
   performance as an exercise.

** Towers of Hanoi

   From Wikipedia:

   #+begin_quote
   The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of
   three rods and a number of disks of different diameters, which can
   slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one
   rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus
   approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to
   move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following simple
   rules:

   - Only one disk may be moved at a time.
   - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the
     stacks and placing it on top of another stack or an empty rod.
   - No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
   #+end_quote

   Let's try to solve Hanoi for 4 disks, from rod A to rod C. Again
   --- "wishful thinking". Let's assume that we know how to solve for
   3 disks. To solve, we'd take the top 3 disks, put it on the spare
   rod B. Then, we'd take the fourth and largest disk, and put it on
   destination rod C. Finally, we'd move the three disk pile from B
   to C. Solved!

   But wait --- to solve the 3 disk case, let's assume we know how to
   solve the 2 disk case.

   To solve the 2 disk case, we should know how
   to solve the one disk case, which is just moving a disk from a rod
   to another.

   Or, in Lisp,

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (move n from to spare)
       (cond ((= n 1) (display "Move disk at rod ")
                      (display from)
                      (display " to rod ")
                      (display to)
                      (display ".\n"))
             (else
              (move (- n 1) from spare to)
              (move 1 from to spare)
              (move (- n 1) spare to from))))

     (move 4 "A" "C" "B")
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_example
   Move disk at rod A to rod B.
   Move disk at rod A to rod C.
   Move disk at rod B to rod C.
   Move disk at rod A to rod B.
   Move disk at rod C to rod A.
   Move disk at rod C to rod B.
   Move disk at rod A to rod B.
   Move disk at rod A to rod C.
   Move disk at rod B to rod C.
   Move disk at rod B to rod A.
   Move disk at rod C to rod A.
   Move disk at rod B to rod C.
   Move disk at rod A to rod B.
   Move disk at rod A to rod C.
   Move disk at rod B to rod C.
   #+end_example

   Note, of course, that this procedure too, is an exponential time
   procedure. However, any procedure for Hanoi will be exponential
   time, since for $n$ disks, Hanoi requires $2^{n-1}$ moves. Even if
   you compute every move in $O(1)$ (which we do, since it's just a
   print), the complexity will be $O(2^n)$.

** Abstracting Procedural Ideas

   Consider the functions and their respective (recursive) procedures:

   $$\sum_{i=a}^{b} i$$

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (sum-int a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ a
              (sum-int (inc a) b))))

     (sum-int 0 10)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   $$\sum_{i=a}^{b} i^{2}$$

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<square>>
     (define (sum-sq a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (square a)
              (sum-sq (inc a) b))))

     (sum-sq 0 4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 30

   $$\sum_{i=a_{\mathrm{~by~}4}}^{b} \frac{1}{i(i+2)}$$

   Note that this series estimates $\pi /8$.

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (sum-pi a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (/ 1
                 (* a (+ a 2)))
              (sum-pi (+ a 4) b))))

     (* 8 (sum-pi #i1 #i1000000))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   See that the commonality between these procedures comes from the
   fact that the notion of "summation" from =a= to =b= is the same,
   but the /function/ being summed is different in each case. Or, in
   general form:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (<name> a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (<term> a)
              (<name> (<next> a) b))))
   #+END_SRC

   The way to solve this is by writing a procedure =sum=, which has
   available to it two procedures =term= and =next=. We supply these
   as arguments. Consider:

   #+NAME: sum
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (sum term a next b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (term a)
              (sum term (next a) next b))))
   #+END_SRC

   When we call =sum= recursively, see that we pass to it the /same
   procedures/ =term= and =next=, along with =b= and the next value of
   =a=. Now, it is easy to define =sum-int=, =sum-sq=, and =sum-pi=
   using =sum=, thus:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<sum>>
     (define (sum-int a b)
       (define (identity x) x)
       (sum identity
            a
            inc
            b))

     (sum-int 0 10)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 55

   =identity= is the function $p(x) = x$.

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<sum>>
     <<square>>
     (define (sum-sq a b)
       (sum square
            a
            inc
            b))

     (sum-sq 0 4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 30

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<sum>>
     (define (sum-pi a b)
       (sum (lambda (x)
              (/ 1
                 (* x (+ x 2))))
            a
            (lambda (x) (+ x 4))
            b))

     (* 8 (sum-pi #i1 #i1000000))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3.141590653589793

   Recall that =lambda= means "make a procedure" that is nameless. In
   =sum-pi=, we choose to give =sum= anonymous functions as arguments
   instead of defining our own, because there's no reason to name a
   procedure we won't later use.

   The big advantage of abstracting away =sum= this way is that in
   case we want to implement it in a different way, we merely have to
   change the implementation of one function (=sum=) and not that of
   the three functions that use it. In fact, those functions can
   remain exactly the same.

   Here's another implementation of =sum=. See that =sum-pi= still
   works without changes, because it doesn't care about how =sum= is
   implemented as long as the argument number and order remains
   constant.

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (sum term a next b)
       (define (iter j ans)
         (if (> j b)
             ans
             (iter (next j)
                   (+ (term j)
                      ans))))
       (iter a 0))

     (define (sum-pi a b)
       (sum (lambda (x)
              (/ 1
                 (* x (+ x 2))))
            a
            (lambda (x) (+ x 4))

** More on Square Roots

   Recall our square root procedure. When seen in Lisp code, it's not
   very clear what it's doing, or how it's working.

   #+NAME: no-dep-sqrt
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both

               (- y)
               y))
         (< (abs (- (square g) x))

   Let's use higher-order procedure abstraction to make it clearer.

*** Fixed Points

    Recall that the algorithm itself relies on writing a function

    $$f\colon y\mapsto \frac{y+\frac{x}{y}}{2}$$

    Note that this works because $f(\sqrt{x}) = \sqrt{x}$:

    $$f(\sqrt{x})=\frac{\sqrt{x}+\frac{x}{\sqrt{x}}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{x}}{2} = \sqrt{x}$$

    See that this is /actually/ an algorithm for finding a fixed point
    of a function $f$, which is defined as finding the point where
    $f(z)=z$. This algorithm is merely an instance of a function $f$
    whose fixed point happens to be the square root.

    #+begin_quote
    For some functions, the fixed point can be found by iterating it.
    #+end_quote

    This is the top-level abstraction we'll write a function for.
    First, let's see how we'd write a square-root function by wishful
    thinking:

    #+NAME: fp-sqrt
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<average>>
      (define (sqrt x)
        (fixed-point
         (lambda (y) (average (/ x y)
                              y))
         1))
    #+END_SRC

    Now writing =fixed-point=:

    #+NAME: fixed-point
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<abs>>
      (define (fixed-point f start)
        (define (close-enough-p x y)
          (< (abs (- x y))
             0.00001))
        (define (iter old new)
          (if (close-enough-p old new)
              new
              (iter new (f new))))
        (iter start (f start)))
    #+END_SRC

    Let's try it out!

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<fixed-point>>
      <<fp-sqrt>>
      (sqrt #i2)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 1.4142135623746899

*** Damping Oscillations

    A fair question when seeing the function
    $$f_1\colon y\mapsto \frac{y+\frac{x}{y}}{2}$$
    is why another function
    $$f\colon y\mapsto \frac{x}{y}$$
    wouldn't work in its place. This question is best
    answered by trying to find its fixed point by iteration. Let's try
    to find it for $x=2$, starting at $y=1$. Then,

    $$f(1) = \frac{2}{1} = 2$$
    $$f(2) = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$
    $$f(1) = \frac{2}{1} = 2$$
    $$f(2) = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$
    $$~\dots$$

    It seems that instead of converging, this function is
    /oscillating/ between two values. We know that it's easy to fix
    this: we have to damp these oscillations. The most natural way to
    do this is to take the average of successive values $y$ and
    $f(y)$. A =sqrt= function that uses average damping would be:

    #+NAME: fp-avg-sqrt
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<fixed-point>>
      (define (sqrt x)
        (fixed-point
         (avg-damp (lambda (y) (/ x y)))
         1))
    #+END_SRC

    The =avg-damp= function takes in a procedure, creates an average damping
    procedure, and returns it. Or, in Lisp:

    #+NAME: avg-damp
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<average>>
      (define avg-damp
        (lambda (f)
          (lambda (x) (average (f x) x))))
    #+END_SRC

    It is worth discussing how =avg-damp= works. It is defined as a
    procedure which takes the argument of a function =f=. It then
    returns an anonymous procedure which takes an argument =x=, and
    computes the average of $f(x)$ and $x$. This is finally the
    highest level of abstraction we can reach for the =sqrt=
    algorithm --- finding the fixed point of a damped oscillating
    function.

    Using the =sqrt= function,

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<avg-damp>>
      <<fp-avg-sqrt>>
      (sqrt #i2)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 1.4142135623746899

** Newton's Method

   Newton's method is used to find the zeros of a function ($y \ni
   f(y)=0$). To use it, start with some guess $y_0$. Then,

   $$y_{n+1} = y_n - \frac{f(y_n)}{f'(y_n)}$$

   where $$f'(y) = \frac{\mathrm{d}f(y)}{\mathrm{d}y}$$

   We can, of course, find the zero of the square root finding function
   $f(y) =  x-y^2$ using Newton's method. Note that Newton's method
   /itself/ is based on fixed points, since it aims to find a fixed
   point where $y_{n+1}\approx y_n$.

   Defining =sqrt=:

   #+NAME: newton-sqrt
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<square>>
     (define (sqrt x)
       (newton (lambda (y) (- x (square y)))
               1))
   #+END_SRC

   We pass to =newton= a function $f(y)=x-y^2$, since its zero is $x=y^2$.

   #+NAME: newton
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<fixed-point>>
     (define (newton f guess)
       (define df (deriv f))
       (fixed-point
        (lambda (x) (- x
                       (/ (f x)
                          (df x))))
        guess))
   #+END_SRC


   It is important to note that defining =df= to be =(deriv f)= once
   prevents wasteful recomputation of =df= every time =fixed-point=
   calls itself.

   Of course, we now have to define a derivative function. We can
   simply use the standard limit definition to find it numerically:

   $$f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta
   x}$$

   Or, in Lisp,

   #+NAME: deriv
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define dx 0.0000001)

     (define deriv
       (lambda (f)
         (lambda (x)
           (/ (- (f (+ x dx))
                 (f x))
              dx))))


   #+END_SRC

   This function returns a function which is the derivative of =f=,
   and can be used as such. Consider:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<deriv>>
     ((deriv (lambda (x) (* x x x))) 2)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 12.000000584322379

   Which is the expected value of differentiating $x^{3}$ w.r.t $x$
   ($3x^2$) and evaluating at 2.

** Procedures are First-Class Citizens

   This means that procedures can be:
   - Named using variables.
   - Passed as arguments to procedures.
   - Returned as values from procedures.
   - Included in data structures.

* Lecture 2B: Compound Data

  Consider our =sqrt= function that uses =good-enough?=. What we did
  while writing =sqrt= is assume the existence of =good-enough?=.
  That is, we divorced the task of building =sqrt= from the task of
  implementing its parts.

  Let's do this for data.

** Rational Number Arithmetic

   Let's design a system which can add fractions:
   $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$$
   and multiply them:
   $$\frac{3}{4}\times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{2}$$

   The /procedures/ for these two tasks are well known to most people:

   $$\frac{n_1}{d_1} + \frac{n_2}{d_2} = \frac{n_1d_2+n_2d_2}{d_1d_2}$$
   and
   $$\frac{n_1}{d_1} \times \frac{n_2}{d_2} = \frac{n_1n_2}{d_1d_2}$$

*** Abstraction
    We don't know, however, how to represent this data in a Lisp
    procedure. Let's use our powerful "wishful thinking" strategy.
    Assume that we have the following procedures available to us:

    - A constructor =(make-rat n d)= which makes a fraction with
      numerator =n= and denominator =d=.
    - Two selectors:
      - =(numer x)= which takes in a fraction =x= and returns its
        numerator.
      - =(denom x)= which takes in a fraction =x= and returns its
        denominator.

    Then, our procedures are easy to write:

    #+NAME: frac-proc
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (+rat x y)
        (make-rat
         (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
            (* (numer y) (denom x)))
         (* (denom x) (denom y))))

      (define (*rat x y)
        (make-rat
         (* (numer x) (numer y))
         (* (denom x) (denom y))))
    #+END_SRC

    Why do we need this data object abstraction anyway? We could very
    well define =+rat= to take in four numbers, two numerators and two
    denominators. But to return, we can't return /both/ numerator and
    denominator. We now have to define two summation functions, one for
    the numerator and one for the denominator, and somehow keep track
    of the fact that one of these numbers is the numerator and the other
    the denominator. Furthermore, when applying more complex operations
    like:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (*rat (+rat x y)
            (+rat s t))
    #+END_SRC

    The data abstraction helps. If it weren't there, we'd have to
    maintain some temporary registers to store the numerator and
    denominator values of the =+rat= operations into, then pass them to
    =*rat=.

    Worse than confusing the program, such a design philosophy would
    confuse us, the programmers.

*** Data Object Creation

    The glue we use to stick two numbers together is provided by three
    Lisp primitives:
    - A constructor =cons=, which generates an ordered pair.
    - Two selectors:
      - =car=, which selects the first element of the pair, and
      - =cdr=, which selects the second element of the pair.

    In use,
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define x (cons 1 2))
      (car x)
      (cdr x)

    : 2

    We can now write the procedures that we'd deferred writing
    earlier:

    #+NAME: make-rat
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-rat x y)
        (cons x y))

      (define (numer x)
        (car x))

      (define (denom x)
        (cdr x))
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<frac-proc>>
      <<make-rat>>

      (define x (make-rat 1 2))
      (define y (make-rat 1 4))
      (define z (+rat x y))
      (numer z)
      (denom z)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 6
    : 8

    Agh. We forgot to reduce results to the simplest form. We can
    easily include this in the =make-rat= procedure:[fn:1]

    #+NAME: make-rat-gcd
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-rat x y)
        (let ((g (gcd x y)))
          (cons (/ x g)
                (/ y g))))

      (define (numer x)
        (car x))

      (define (denom x)
        (cdr x))
    #+END_SRC

    Note that we could shift the =gcd= bit to functions =numer= and
    =denom=, which would display the simplest form at access time
    rather than creation time. Deciding between the two is a matter of
    system efficiency: a system which displays often should use
    creation time simplification, while a system which creates many
    fractions should use access time simplification.
    We now need a GCD function:

    #+NAME: gcd
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (gcd a b)
        (if (= b 0)
            a
            (gcd b (remainder a b))))
    #+END_SRC

    We can now use =+rat= in /exactly/ the same way, since the
    interface is the same. This is the advantage of abstraction.

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<make-rat-gcd>>
      <<frac-proc>>

      (define x (make-rat 1 2))
      (define y (make-rat 1 4))
      (define z (+rat x y))
      (numer z)
      (denom z)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 3
    : 4

    Excellent: we now have a working system. The data abstraction
    model can be visualised as follows:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t :align c
    | =+rat=, =*rat= ...           |
    |------------------------------|
    | =make-rat=, =numer=, =denom= |
    |------------------------------|
    | =gcd=                        |
    |------------------------------|
    | Pairs                        |

    At each layer of abstraction, we merely care about the usage of
    the lower layers and not their implementation or underlying
    representation.

** Representing Points on a Plane

   This is now an easy problem --- the code should be
   self-explanatory.

   #+NAME: make-vec
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (make-vec x y)
       (cons x y))

     (define (xcor v)
       (car v))

     (define (ycor v)
       (cdr v))
   #+END_SRC

   We could now define a segment as a pair of vectors:

   #+NAME: make-seg
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (make-seg v w)
       (cons v w))

     (define (seg-start s)
       (car s))

     (define (seg-end s)
       (cdr s))
   #+END_SRC

   Some sample operations:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<average>>
     <<square>>
     <<no-dep-sqrt>>
     <<make-vec>>
     <<make-seg>>

     (define (midpoint s)
       (let ((a (seg-start s))
             (b (seg-end s)))
         (make-vec
          (average (xcor a) (xcor b))
          (average (ycor a) (ycor b)))))

     (define (length s)
       (let ((dx (- (xcor (seg-end s))
                    (xcor (seg-start s))))
             (dy (- (ycor (seg-end s))
                    (ycor (seg-start s)))))
         (sqrt (+ (square dx)
                  (square dy)))))

     (define side-a (make-vec #i3 #i0))
     (define side-b (make-vec #i0 #i4))
     (define segment (make-seg side-a side-b))

     (length segment)

     (define mp (midpoint segment))

     (xcor mp)
     (ycor mp)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 5.000000000053722
   : 1.5
   : 2.0

   The abstraction layer diagram of this code is:


   #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t :align c
   | Segments |
   |----------|
   | Vectors  |
   |----------|
   | Pairs    |

   It is interesting to note that segments are pairs of vectors,
   which are pairs of numbers, so segments are actually pairs of
   pairs. Represented as a tree:

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
   #+LATEX: [$s$ [$\vec{v_{1}}$ [$x_{1}$] [$y_{1}$]] [$\vec{v_{2}}$ [$x_2$] [$y_2$]]]
   #+LATEX: \end{forest}
   #+LATEX: \end{center}

   This property is called /closure/ (from abstract algebra[fn:2]): that means
   of combination can be nested recursively. It's an important and
   powerful technique.

   For instance, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a
   pair whose one element is a number and whose other element is a
   pair of numbers. Or, in Lisp:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define three-d-vec (cons 3 (cons 4 5)))
     (car three-d-vec)
     (car (cdr three-d-vec))
     (cdr (cdr three-d-vec))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
   : 4
   : 5

** Pairs

   Let's go back to when we assumed that =make-rat=, =numer=, and
   =denom=, were already implemented. The procedures we then wrote
   were written using /abstract data/, with the only "assured"
   property being that:

   #+begin_verse
   =if x = (make-rat n d):=

     $\displaystyle \frac{\mathtt{numer~x}}{\mathtt{denom~x}} = \frac{\mathtt{n}}{\mathtt{d}}$
   #+end_verse

   Beyond this basic "spec", or the interface contract, we know
   nothing about its implementation.

   Now, it's easy not to appreciate how knowing /merely/ the
   specification of the layer below is sufficient to use it, so let's
   discuss how pairs work. When we wanted to implement =make-rat=, we
   kind of "cheated" in that we said, "Okay, Lisp has a primitive to
   do this so we don't have to implement a pair." Let's now take a
   look at a possible implementation of a pair that doesn't use data
   objects at all, and instead mimics them from thin air. Consider:

   #+NAME: our-cons
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (our-cons a b)
       (lambda (pick)
         (cond ((= pick 1) a)
               ((= pick 2) b))))

     (define (our-car x) (x 1))
     (define (our-cdr x) (x 2))
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<our-cons>>
     (define pair (our-cons 3 4))
     (our-car pair)
     (our-cdr pair)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
   : 4

   Before thinking about how it works: consider the fact that Lisp's
   pairs could be implemented this way, and not only would we not know
   about this while implementing =make-rat= --- we wouldn't care,
   since it's below the level of abstraction we're working at. As long
   as it behaves the way we expect it to --- that is, it follows the
   "spec", we don't know or care about its implementation[fn:3]. Such is the
   power of abstraction.

   Now, how is this implementation even working? Well:
   - =cons= is a procedure that returns a lambda (anonymous procedure)
     which, by the substitution model, looks like:
     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
       (lambda (pick)
         (cond ((= pick 1) 3)
               ((= pick 2) 4)))
     #+END_SRC
   - =car= expects this procedure as an input, and returns the result of
     supplying this procedure with the value 1. This is naturally the
     first of the two numbers given to =cons= (=a=).
   - =cdr= is identical to =car=, except that /it/ supplies the input
     procedure with argument 2 to get =b=.

   We can thus implement a pair "data structure" using only lambdas.
   In fact, these pairs are closed:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<our-cons>>
     (define three-d-vec (our-cons 3 (our-cons 4 5)))
     (our-car three-d-vec)
     (our-car (our-cdr three-d-vec))
     (our-cdr (our-cdr three-d-vec))
     (our-cdr three-d-vec)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
   : 4
   : 5
   : #<procedure:...6f_i/ob-2136OZJ.rkt:4:2>

   It is worth thinking about the structure of =three-d-vec=:
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (lambda (pick)
       (cond ((= pick 1) 3)
             ((= pick 2) (lambda (pick)
                           (cond ((= pick 1) 4)
                                 ((= pick 2) 5))))))
   #+END_SRC

   Picking =2= in the top-level lambda gives us another lambda, in
   which we can pick either the first number (4) or the second (5).
   Note that this is precisely the nested pair structure we were going
   for.

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
   #+LATEX: [$\lambda$(p) [3] [$\lambda$(p) [4] [5]]]
   #+LATEX: \end{forest}
   #+LATEX: \end{center}

* Lecture 3A: Henderson Escher Example

  Recall our vector procedures:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (make-vec x y)
       (cons x y))

     (define (xcor v)
       (car v))

     (define (ycor v)
       (cdr v))
   #+END_SRC

   We could define more procedures using these:

   #+NAME: vec-proc
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (+vect v1 v2)
       (make-vec
        (+ (xcor v1) (xcor v2))
        (+ (ycor v1) (ycor v2))))

     (define (scale v s)
       (make-vec
        (* s (xcor v))
        (* s (ycor v))))
   #+END_SRC

   Recall that our representation of a line segment was as a pair of
   vectors, or pair of pairs. That is, we can use the property of
   closure that pairs have to store any amount of data.

** Lists
   Often, we want to store a sequence of data. Using pairs, there are
   many ways to do this, for instance:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (cons (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4))
     (cons (cons 1 (cons 2 3)) 4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : ((1 . 2) 3 . 4)
   : ((1 2 . 3) . 4)

   However, we want to establish a conventional way of dealing with
   sequences, to prevent having to make ad-hoc choices. Lisp uses a
   representation called a list:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (1 2 3 4)

   Note that the =nil= represents the null or empty list. Since
   writing so many =cons= is painful, Lisp provides the primitive
   =list= which lets us build such a structure.

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (list 1 2 3 4)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (1 2 3 4)

   Note that =list= is merely syntactic sugar for building up using
   pairs:

   #+NAME: one-to-four
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define one-to-four (list 1 2 3 4))
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<one-to-four>>
     (car one-to-four)
     (cdr one-to-four)
     (car (cdr one-to-four))
     (cdr (cdr one-to-four))
     (car (cdr (cdr (cdr one-to-four))))
     (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr one-to-four))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1
   : (2 3 4)
   : 2
   : (3 4)
   : 4
   : ()

   Note that the empty list, =nil=, is also represented by =()=. This
   way of walking down the list for elements is called =cdr=-ing down
   a list, but it's a bit painful. Thus, when we want to process
   lists, we write procedures.

*** Procedures on Lists

    Say we wanted to write a procedure =scale-list= which multiplies
    every element in the list by a certain value. That is, when scale
    list is called on =one-to-four= with value 10, it returns =(10 20
    30 40)=. Here's one possible (recursive) implementation:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<one-to-four>>
      (define (scale-list l scale)
        (if (null? l)
            nil
            (cons (* scale (car l))
                  (scale-list (cdr l) scale))))

      (scale-list one-to-four 10)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : (10 20 30 40)

    =null?= is a predicate which tells us whether the given input is
    the empty list. This will be the case at the end of the list.
    Of course, this is /actually/ a general method for processing all
    values of a list and returning another list, so we write a
    higher-order procedure which applies a procedure to all elements
    of a list and returns the result as a list, called =map=.

    #+NAME: map
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (map p l)
        (if (null? l)
            nil
            (cons (p (car l))
                  (map p (cdr l)))))
    #+END_SRC

    Now defining =scale-list= in terms of =map=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<map>>
      <<one-to-four>>
      (define (scale-list l s)
        (map (lambda (x) (* x s))
             l))

      (scale-list one-to-four 20)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : (20 40 60 80)

    We can now square lists:
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<square>>
      <<map>>
      <<one-to-four>>
      (map square one-to-four)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : (1 4 9 16)

    Similar to =map=, we define a higher-order procedure =for-each=,
    which, instead of =cons=-ing a list and returning it, simply
    applies to procedure to each element of the list.

    #+NAME: for-each
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      (define (for-each proc l)
        (cond ((null? l) done)
              (else
               (proc (car l))
               (for-each proc (cdr l)))))
    #+END_SRC

** Henderson's Picture Language

   Let's define a language. As usual, we'll concern ourselves with its
   primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction,
   implementing some of this language in Lisp along the way.


*** Primitives
    This language has only one primitive: "picture", which is a figure
    scaled to fit a frame.


*** Means of Combination and Operations

    - Rotate, which rotates a picture and returns it.
    - Flip, which flips the picture across an axis and returns it.
    - Beside, which takes two pictures and a scale, then puts the two
      next to each other, returning a picture.
    - Above, like beside, but above.

    See that the closure property (that an operation on pictures
    returns a picture)[fn:4] allows us to combine these operations/means of
    combination to build complex pictures with ease.

    Let's now implement this part of the language.

*** An Implementation

**** Frames

     Three vectors are needed to uniquely identify a frame on the
     plane. By convention, we take these to be the bottom left corner
     ("origin"), the bottom right corner ("horizontal") and the top
     left corner ("vertical"). Their positions can be described
     relative to the $(0,0)$ of the display screen. Therefore,
     frame is implemented by:
     - Constructor =make-frame=.
     - Selectors =origin=, =horiz=, and =vert=, for the three vectors.

     Note that technically, a frame describes a transformation of
     the unit square, where each point in the unit square:
     $$(x,y)\mapsto \mathtt{origin} + x\cdot \mathtt{horiz} + y\cdot
     \mathtt{vert}$$

     We can define a procedure which returns a procedure which maps
     a pair of points $(x,y)$ on the unit square to a given frame:

     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
       (define (coord-map rect)
         (lambda (point)
           (+vect
            (+vect (scale (xcor point)
                          (horiz rect))
                   (scale (ycor point)
                          (vert rect)))
            (origin rect))))
     #+END_SRC

     =coord-map= returns a procedure which given a point will map it
     correctly to =rect=.

**** Pictures

     We can now easily define a procedure which makes a picture:
     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
       (define (make-picture seglist)
         (lambda (rect)
           (for-each
            (lambda (s)
              (drawline
               ((coord-map rect) (seg-start s))
               ((coord-map rect) (seg-end s))))
            seglist)))
     #+END_SRC

     Well, relatively easily. Let's explain what =make-picture=
     actually does:

     - Takes argument =seglist=, which is a list of line segments
       (pairs of vectors) that the picture is.
     - Returns a procedure which:
       - Takes the argument of a frame.
       - For every element in =seglist=:
         - Draws the segment within frame, by scaling it correctly
           using =coord-map=.
         - This is done by giving =coord-map= the frame to scale
           to.
         - The procedure returned by =coord-map= then scales the
           vectors =(seg-start s)= and =(seg-end s)= to the frame.
         - This can now be drawn by =drawline=, since it has as
           arguments two points.

     Note that a picture is /actually/ a procedure which draws itself
     inside a given frame, and =make-picture= generates this
     procedure from a =seglist=. Or, in use:

     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
       (define R (make-frame ;some vectors
                  ))
       (define draw-george-in-frame (make-picture ;some seglist
                       ))
       (draw-george-in-frame R)
     #+END_SRC

**** Beside

     =beside= needs to draw two pictures on the screen, after scaling
     them correctly (by =a=) and placing them side by side. Thus,
     =beside= returns a picture which takes in an argument =rect=.
     =beside= starts drawing the left picture at =(origin rect),
     (scale a (horiz rect)) (vert rect)= and the right picture at
     =(+vect (origin rect) (scale a (horiz rect))), (scale (- 1 a)
     (horiz rect)), (vert rect)=. This places the two pictures side by
     side and scales them correctly within =rect=. Or, in Lisp,

     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
       (define (beside p1 p2 a)
         (lambda (rect)
           (p1 (make-frame
                (origin rect)
                (scale a (horiz rect))
                (vert rect)))
           (p2 (make-frame
                (+vect (origin rect)
                       (scale a (horiz rect)))
                (scale (-1 a) (horiz rect))
                (vert rect)))))
     #+END_SRC

**** Rotate-90

     To rotate a picture by 90 degrees counter-clockwise, all we have
     to do is make the =origin= shift to where =horiz= is, then draw
     the new =horiz= and =vert= correctly. With some vector algebra,
     the procedure in Lisp is:

     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
       (define (rot90 pict)
         (lambda (rect)
           (pict (make-frame
                  (+vect (origin rect)
                         (horiz rect))
                  (vert rect)
                  (scale -1 (horiz rect))))))
     #+END_SRC


*** Means of Abstraction
    See that the picture language is now embedded in Lisp. We can
    write recursive procedures to modify a picture:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (right-push pict n a)
        (if (= n 0)
            pict
            (beside pict
                    (right-push pict (dec n) a)
                    a)))
    #+END_SRC

    We can even write a higher order procedure for "pushing":
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (push comb)
        (lambda (pict n a)
          ((repeated
            (lambda (p)
              (comb pict p a))
            n)
           pict)))

      (define right-push (push beside))
    #+END_SRC

    There's a lot to learn from this example:
    - We're embedding a language inside Lisp. All of Lisp's power is
      available to this small language now: including recursion.
    - There's no difference between a procedure and data: we're
      passing pictures around exactly like data, even though it's
      actually a procedure.
    - We've created a layered system of abstractions on top of Lisp,
      which allows /each layer/ to have all of Lisp's expressive
      power. This is contrasted to a designing such a system bottom-up
      as a tree, which would mean that:
      - Each node does a very specific purpose and is limited in
        complexity because a new feature has to be built ground-up at
        the node.
      - Making a change is near impossible, since there's no higher
        order procedural abstraction. Making a change that affects
        more than one node is a nightmare.

* Lecture 3B: Symbolic Differentiation; Quotation

  We saw that robust system design involves insensitivity to small
  changes, and that embedding a language within Lisp allows this. Let
  us turn to a somewhat similar thread, solving the problem of
  symbolic differentiation in Lisp.

  This problem is somewhat different from /numerical/ differentiation
  of a function like we did for Newton's method, since we actually
  want the expressions we work with to be in an algebraic language.
  Before figuring out how to implement such a thing, let's talk about
  the operation of differentiation itself.

** Differentiation v. Integration

   Why is it so much easier to differentiate than to integrate?
   Let us look at the basic rules of differentiation:

   $$\frac{\mathrm{d}k}{\mathrm{d}x} = 0$$
   $$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}x} = 1$$
   $$\frac{\mathrm{d}k\cdot a}{\mathrm{d}x} = k\cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}a}{\mathrm{d}x}$$
   $$\frac{\mathrm{d}(a+b)}{\mathrm{d}x} =
   \frac{\mathrm{d}a}{\mathrm{d}x} + \frac{\mathrm{d}b}{\mathrm{d}x}$$
   $$\frac{\mathrm{d}(ab)}{\mathrm{d}x} =  a\cdot
   \frac{\mathrm{d}b}{\mathrm{d}x} +
   \frac{\mathrm{d}a}{\mathrm{d}x}\cdot b$$
   $$\frac{\mathrm{d}x^{n}}{\mathrm{d}x} = nx^{n-1}$$

   See that these rules are reduction rules, in that the derivative of
   some complex thing is the derivative of simpler things joined
   together by basic operations. Such reduction rules are naturally
   recursive in nature. This makes the problem of differentiation very
   easy to solve using simple algorithms.

   On the other hand, implementing an integration system is a much
   harder problem, since such a system would require us to go the
   other way, combining up simpler expressions to make more
   complicated ones, which often involves an intrinsically difficult
   choice to make.

   With these simple recursive rules in mind, let's implement a
   symbolic differentiation system.

** Some Wishful Thinking

   #+NAME: sym-deriv
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (deriv expr var)
       (cond ((constant? expr var) 0)
             ((same-var? expr var) 1)
             ((sum? expr)
              (make-sum (deriv (a1 expr) var)
                        (deriv (a2 expr) var)))
             ((product? expr)
              (make-sum
               (make-product (m1 expr)
                             (deriv (m2 expr) var))
               (make-product (deriv (m1 expr) var)
                             (m2 expr))))))
   #+END_SRC


   That's enough rules for now, we can add more later.

   Note that =a1= is a procedure returning the first term of the
   addition $x+y$ (in this case, $x$), and =a2= is a procedure
   returning the second (in this case, $y$). Similar for
   multiplication, =m1= and =m2=.

   All the -=?= procedures are predicates, and should be
   self-explanatory. =make-=, as expected, makes the object with given
   arguments as values and returns it. These are a level of
   abstraction below =deriv=, and involve the actual representation of
   algebraic expressions. Let's figure out how to do this.

** Representing Algebraic Expressions

*** Using Lisp Syntax

    One very simple way to represent expressions is to use Lisp's way:
    expressions that form trees. Consider:

    $$ax^{2} \mapsto \mathtt{(*~a~(*~x~x))}$$ $$bx+c \mapsto \mathtt{(
    \mathtt{+} ~(*~b~x)~c)}$$

    This has the advantage that representing such expression is just a
    list. Moreover, finding out the operation is merely the =car= of
    the list, and the operands are the =cdr=. This effectively
    eliminates our need for parsing algebraic expressions.

*** Representation Implementation

    Let's start defining our procedures.

    #+NAME: atom?
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none
      (define (atom? x)
        (and (not (null? x))
             (not (pair? x))))
    #+END_SRC


    #+NAME: deriv-preds
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (constant? expr var)
        (and (atom? expr)
             (not (eq? expr var))))

      (define (same-var? expr var)
        (and (atom? expr)
             (eq? expr var)))

      (define (sum? expr)
        (and (not (atom? expr))
             (eq? (car expr) '+)))

      (define (product? expr)
        (and (not (atom? expr))
             (eq? (car expr) '*)))
    #+END_SRC

    We see a new form here: ='+= and ='*=. This is called "quoting".
    Why do we need to do this? Consider:

    #+begin_verse
    "Say your name!"
    "Susanne."
    "Say 'your name'!"
    "Your name."
    #+end_verse

    To differentiate the cases where we mean /literally/ say "your
    name" and the case where we actually ask what "your name" /is/, we
    use quotation marks in English. Similarly, quoting a symbol in
    Lisp tells the interpreter to check /literally/ for =(car expr)=
    to be the symbol =+= and not the procedure =+=.

    Quotation is actually quite a complicated thing. Following the
    principle of substituting equals for equals, consider:

    #+begin_verse
    "Chicago" has seven letters.
    Chicago is the biggest city in Illinois.
    "The biggest city in Illinois" has seven letters.
    #+end_verse

    The first two statements are true, and quotation marks are used
    correctly in the first to show that we're talking about Chicago
    the word and not Chicago the city. However, the third statement is
    wrong entirely (although it is the result of changing equals for
    equals), because the phrase "The biggest city in Illinois" does
    not have seven letters.
    That is, we cannot substitute equals for equals in referentially
    opaque contexts.

    Note that the ='= symbol breaks the neat pattern of Lisp where all
    expressions are delimited by =()=. To resolve this, we introduce
    the special form =(quote +)=, which does the exactly same thing as
    ='+=.

    Now defining the constructors:

    #+NAME: deriv-makes
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-sum a1 a2)
        (list '+ a1 a2))

      (define (make-product m1 m2)
        (list '* m1 m2))
    #+END_SRC


    Finally, we must define the selectors:

    #+NAME: deriv-cadr
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define a1 cadr)
      (define a2 caddr)

      (define m1 cadr)
      (define m2 caddr)
    #+END_SRC


    =cadr= is the =car= of the =cdr= and =caddr= is the =car= of the
    =cdr= of the =cdr=. These are forms provided for convenience while
    programming, since list processing a big part of Lisp.[fn:5]

    Let's try it out:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<atom?>>
      <<deriv-preds>>
      <<deriv-makes>>
      <<deriv-cadr>>
      <<sym-deriv>>

      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'x)
      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'a)
      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'b)
      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'c)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : (+ (+ (* a (+ (* x 1) (* 1 x))) (* 0 (* x x))) (+ (+ (* b 1) (* 0 x)) 0))
    : (+ (+ (* a (+ (* x 0) (* 0 x))) (* 1 (* x x))) (+ (+ (* b 0) (* 0 x)) 0))
    : (+ (+ (* a (+ (* x 0) (* 0 x))) (* 0 (* x x))) (+ (+ (* b 0) (* 1 x)) 0))
    : (+ (+ (* a (+ (* x 0) (* 0 x))) (* 0 (* x x))) (+ (+ (* b 0) (* 0 x)) 1))

    Note the recursive nature of =deriv=: the process creates results
    with the same shape even when we differentiate with respect to
    some other variable. This is because the recursion only ends when
    an expression is decomposed to either =same-var?= or =constant?=.

*** Simplification

    However, these results are ugly, and we know why --- there's no
    simplification. Technically, it's correct:

    \begin{align*}
    &a(1x+1x) + 0x^{2} + b + 0x + 0\\
    =& 2ax + b
    \end{align*}

    Note that we've faced this same problem before with fractions, and
    recall that the solution was to change the constructors so that
    they'd simplify while creating the lists. Consider:

    #+NAME: deriv-makes-2
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-sum a1 a2)
        (cond ((and (number? a1)
                    (number? a2))
               (+ a1 a2))
              ((and (number? a1)
                    (= a1 0))
               a2)
               ((and (number? a2)
                    (= a2 0))
                a1)
               (else
                (list '+ a1 a2))))

      (define (make-product m1 m2)
        (cond ((and (number? m1)
                    (number? m2))
               (* m1 m2))
              ((and (number? m1)
                    (= m1 0))
               0)
               ((and (number? m2)
                    (= m2 0))
                0)
               ((and (number? m1)
                     (= m1 1))
                m2)
               ((and (number? m2)
                     (= m2 1))
                m1)
               (else
                (list '+ m1 m2))))
    #+END_SRC

    Now trying =deriv=:


    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<atom?>>
      <<deriv-preds>>
      <<deriv-makes-2>>
      <<deriv-cadr>>
      <<sym-deriv>>

      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'x)
      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'a)
      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'b)
      (deriv '(+ (* a (* x x)) (+ (* b x) c)) 'c)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : (+ (+ a (+ x x)) b)
    : (* x x)
    : x
    : 1

    Excellent, these are much better. Note, of course, that we could
    simplify the first one further, but, in general, algebraic
    simplification is a painful problem, since the definition of
    simplest form varies with application. However, this is good
    enough.

** On Abstract Syntax

   Note that the syntax we used was abstract in the sense that it had
   its own rules and grammar. However, since it followed Lisp's syntax
   closely, we needed quotation to allow full expression.

   This is a powerful paradigm: not only can we use meta-linguistic
   abstraction to create languages embedded within Lisp, but we can
   also use Lisp to interpret any syntax. We'll see more of this in
   the future.

* Lecture 4A: Pattern Matching and Rule-Based Substitution

  It's a funny technique we used last time, converting the rules of
  differentiation to Lisp. In fact, if we wanted to explain (say) the
  rules of algebra to the computer, we'd have to again create a
  similar program which converts the rules of algebra to Lisp.

  See that there's a higher-order idea here, of explaining rules to
  Lisp and having the rules applied to an input expression to
  "simplify" it. Our style of writing a rule-based substitution
  program is:

  Rules \rightarrow conditional \rightarrow dispatch

  That is, we try the rules on the given expression. If there's a
  match, we "dispatch" the result to substitute. Now, in general, the
  application of a rule is:

  - Compare LHS of rule to input expression.
  - If match, RHS with substituted values is replacement.

  Or, diagrammatically:

  #+LATEX: \[\begin{tikzcd} \mathrm{Pattern} \arrow{r}{\mathrm{Rule}}
  #+LATEX: \arrow[swap]{d}{\mathrm{Matched}} & \mathrm{Skeleton}
  #+LATEX: \arrow{d}{\mathrm{Instantiation}} \\ \mathrm{Expression_{Src}}
  #+LATEX: \arrow[mapsto]{r} & \mathrm{Expression_{Target}} \end{tikzcd} \]

  Let us now build a simple language to express these rules, which can
  then be pattern matched, skeletons created, then instantiated.

** Rule Language

   Here's a sample bit of what we want the rule language to look like:

   #+NAME: rule-deriv-rules
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define deriv-rules
       '(
         ((dd (?c c) (? v)) 0)
         ((dd (?v v) (? v)) 1)
         ((dd (?v u) (? v)) 0)

         ((dd (* (?c c) (? x)) (? v)) (* (: c) (dd (: x) (: v))))

         ((dd (+ (? x1) (? x2)) (? v))
          (+ (dd (: x1) (: v))
             (dd (: x2) (: v))))

         ((dd (* (? x1) (? x2)) (? v))
          (+ (* (: x1) (dd (: x2) (: v)))
             (* (: x2) (dd (: x1) (: v)))))
         ; ...
         ))
   #+END_SRC

   It is worth explaining what this syntax means exactly, because
   eventually, we want to parse it.

   The rules are a list of pairs. The =car= of each pair is the
   pattern to match (rule LHS), and the =cdr= is the skeleton
   substitution expression (rule RHS).

*** Pattern Matching

    The idea of the LHS language is to provide a framework where
    certain constructs can be matched and possibly named. These names
    will then be passed to the skeleton instantiator.[fn:6]

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
    | Syntax    | Meaning                                                                     |
    |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | =foo=     | Matches itself literally.                                                   |
    | =(f a b)= | Matches every 3-list whose =car= is =f=, =cadr= is =a=, and =caddr= is =b=. |
    | =(? x)=   | Matches any expression, and calls it =x=.                                   |
    | =(?c x)=  | Matches an expression which is a constant, and calls it =x=.                |
    | =(?v x)=  | Matches an expression which is a variable, and calls it =x=.                |


*** Skeleton and Instantiation
    The RHS language provides a skeleton wherein values provided by
    the LHS language can be substituted.

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
    | Syntax    | Meaning                                                       |
    |-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
    | =foo=     | Instantiates =foo=.                                           |
    | =(f a b)= | Instantiates each element of the list and returns a list.     |
    | =(: x)=   | Instantiate the value of =x= provided by the pattern matcher. |

** Desired Behaviour

   We expect to use this program by calling a procedure called
   =simplifier=, to which we provide the list of rules. The procedure
   should return another procedure, which is able to apply the rules
   to a given input expression. Or, in Lisp:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define dsimp
       (simplifier deriv-rules))

     (dsimp '(dd (+ x y) x))
   #+END_SRC

   #+begin_example
    (+ 1 0)
   #+end_example

** Implementation

   We implement a procedure =match=, which takes a pattern, an
   expression, and a dictionary as arguments. If that pattern matches
   the expression, it writes the =?= values to the dictionary and
   returns it. Next, we implement =instantiate=, which takes as
   arguments a skeleton and a dictionary, and substitutes variables in
   the skeleton with their dictionary values. Finally, this new
   expression is returned to the =match=-er to match more patterns.
   Finally, we implement =simplify=, which takes in a list of the
   rules and applies these in a match-instantiate cycle until the
   expression cannot be further simplified (no more change after a
   round of match-instantiate).

*** Matcher

    Abstractly, the job of the matcher is to do a tree traversal and
    comparison. Consider the rule LHS: =(+ (* (? x) (? y)) (? y))=,
    and an expression to match: =(+ (* 3 x) x)= (say). Then, the trees
    are:

    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [+ [* [\texttt{(? x)}] [\texttt{(? y)}]] [\texttt{(? y)}]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [+ [* [\texttt{3}] [\texttt{x}]] [\texttt{x}]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}

    Clearly, these expressions should be matched in the tree
    traversal. Don't confuse the =(? x)= in the rule LHS with the
    symbol =x= in the expression: for the rule, it's just a matching
    variable, but the =x= in the expression goes into the dictionary.

    Let's now write our first implementation of =match=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (match pat expr dict)
        (cond ((eq? dict 'failed) 'failed)
              ; ... some other cases
              ((atom? expr) 'failed)
              (else
               (match (cdr pat)
                       (cdr expr)
                       (match (car pat)
                               (car expr)
                               dict)))))
    #+END_SRC

    Before we write the entire procedure, let's observe how the
    general case (=else=) works, because that's the bit which does the
    tree traversal. It calls =match= on the =car= of the pattern and
    expression. If they match, we return a dictionary, which is then
    used to match the =cdr= of the original expression. Why does this
    do tree traversal? Well, it's basically a depth first search on a
    tree. Consider what happens when =match= is called on the =car=.
    After being called for the =caar= and =caaar=...it'll eventually
    be called for the =cadr= and the =caddr= and so on. That's
    precisely what a depth first search is. It'll keep going deeper
    and deeper until it fails, which is when it takes one step back
    and goes deeper into another branch.

    Now, it is important to define the non-general cases, especially
    the ones that terminate =match=. The most important of these is
    when the expression passed is atomic, since that means we're at
    the leaf of the expression tree. Another possible failure is the
    insertion into the dictionary failing. How is this possible?
    Consider:

    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [+ [* [\texttt{(? x)}] [\texttt{(? y)}]] [\boxed{\texttt{(?~y)}}]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [+ [* [\texttt{3}] [\texttt{x}]] [\boxed{\texttt{q}}]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}

    Just before =match= reaches the last leaf (boxed), our dictionary will look
    something like the following:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
    | rule-vars | expr-vals |
    |-----------+-----------|
    | x         | 3         |
    | y         | x         |

    However, when it tries to insert =y: q=, the dictionary will
    =failed= to do so, because =y= already has value =x=, and thus the
    rule does not match.

    Finally, we implement as more cases in the =cond= other things we
    may need to match, according to the rule language ([[Rule Language]]).

    #+NAME: rule-match
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (match pattern expression dict)
        (cond ((eq? dict 'failed) 'failed)

              ((atom? pattern)
               (if (atom? expression)
                   (if (eq? pattern expression)
                       dict
                       'failed)
                   'failed))

              ((arbitrary-constant? pattern)
               (if (constant? expression)
                   (extend-dict pattern expression dict)
                   'failed))

              ((arbitrary-variable? pattern)
               (if (variable? expression)
                   (extend-dict pattern expression dict)
                   'failed))

              ((arbitrary-expression? pattern)
               (extend-dict pattern expression dict))

              ((atom? expression) 'failed)

              (else
               (match (cdr pattern)
                       (cdr expression)
                       (match (car pattern)
                               (car expression)
                               dict)))))
    #+END_SRC

    We add one case wherein both the pattern to be matched and the
    expression are atomic and the same, (the case =foo= in [[Rule
    Language]]), in which we simply return the dictionary, since the
    pattern matches. The other new cases are self-explanatory: they are
    merely matching =(?c)=, =(?v)=, and =(?)=.


*** Instantiator

    Recall that instantiate must take accept the input of a skeleton
    and a dictionary, traverse the skeleton tree, and replace rule
    variables for expression values according to the dictionary. That
    is, given the tree:

    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [* [\texttt{(: x)}] [\texttt{(: y)}]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}

    And the dictionary =(x: 3, y: 4)=, it should produce the tree:

    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
    #+LATEX: [* [\texttt{3}] [\texttt{4}]]
    #+LATEX: \end{forest}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}

    This is a fairly simple procedure to write:

    #+NAME: rule-instantiate
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (instantiate skeleton dict)
        (cond ((atom? skeleton) skeleton)
              ((skeleton-evaluation? skeleton)
               (evaluate (evaluation-expression skeleton)
                         dict))
              (else (cons (instantiate (car skeleton) dict)
                          (instantiate (cdr skeleton) dict)))))
    #+END_SRC

    The general case is our usual tree recursion: it first
    instantiates the =car=, then =cons=' that with the instantiated
    =cdr=. The depth-first search ends if the leaf is atomic, as
    usual.

    The interesting bit is what we do when we want to evaluate a
    skeleton of the =(:)= form (predicate =skeleton-evaluation?=). In
    this case, we call a procedure =evaluate=, to which we pass the
    expression to be evaluated (the =cadr=, really, since we don't
    need the =:=).

    Now, =evaluate= works in a special way we'll see later, so take on
    faith that the following =evaluate= function does its job of
    instantiation the way we want it to:

    #+NAME: rule-evaluate
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (evaluation-expression evaluation) (cadr evaluation))

      (define (evaluate form dict)
        (if (atom? form)
            (lookup form dict)
            (apply (eval (lookup (car form) dict)
                         user-initial-environment)
                   (map (lambda (v) (lookup v dict))
                        (cdr form)))))
    #+END_SRC

*** GIGO Simplifier

    The GIGO (garbage in, garbage out)[fn:7] simplifier is implemented
    by stringing together the matcher, the instantiator, and the list
    of rules we are given as an input. We write it in lexically scoped
    style, because the procedures within it are merely helpers.

    #+NAME: rule-simplifier
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (simplifier the-rules)
        (define (simplify-expression expression)
          (try-rules
           (if (compound? expression)
               (map simplify-expression expression)
               expression)))
        (define (try-rules expression)
          (define (scan rules)
            (if (null? rules)
                expression
                (let ((dict (match (pattern (car rules))
                              expression
                              (make-empty-dict))))
                  (if (eq? dict 'failed)
                      (scan (cdr rules))
                      (simplify-expression (instantiate
                                               (skeleton (car rules))
                                               dict))))))
        (scan the-rules))
        simplify-expression)
    #+END_SRC

    Okay, there's a fair amount to break down here.
    - =simplify-expression= tries /all/ the rules on every node in the
      given expression tree. It does this using our (by now) standard
      depth first tree recursion. In this case, the leaf is an atomic
      expression. The general case is when the expression is compound,
      in which case we try to simplify the =car=. If this doesn't
      work, we try the =cdr=, recursively. This fulfils our objective
      of trying all rules on all nodes. Note that instead of doing the
      recursion explicitly, we use =map=. This doesn't make a
      difference, it is merely somewhat easier to write.
    - =try-rules= accepts an expression as an input, and scans the
      input list of rules, applying each in turn using =scan=.
    - =scan= takes the pattern of the first rule in the list and tries
      to match it to the expression. If it succeeds, we instantiate
      the skeleton of this rule with the values from the dictionary.
      On the other hand, if the =match= failed, we simply try the rest
      of the rules (=cdr=).
    - Finally, =simplifier= returns the =simplify-expression=
      procedure, which can apply =the-rules= to any input expression.
      Note that this is what the desired behaviour is ([[Desired
      Behaviour]]).

*** Dictionary Implementation
    The actual dictionary implementation isn't of much interest to us,
    since it has much more to do with Lisp primitives we'll study
    later than our program.

    #+NAME: rule-dict
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-empty-dict) '())

      (define (extend-dict pat dat dictionary)
        (let ((vname (variable-name pat)))
          (let ((v (assq vname dictionary)))
            (cond ((not v)
                   (cons (list vname dat) dictionary))
                  ((eq? (cadr v) dat) dictionary)
                  (else 'failed)))))

      (define (lookup var dictionary)
        (let ((v (assq var dictionary)))
          (if (null? v)
              var
              (cadr v))))
    #+END_SRC

*** Predicates
    Finally, we must implement the predicates we've used throughout.
    These are simple to implement and self-explanatory:

    #+NAME: rule-preds
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (compound? exp) (pair? exp))
      (define (constant? exp) (number? exp))
      (define (variable? exp) (atom? exp))
      (define (pattern rule) (car rule))
      (define (skeleton rule) (cadr rule))

      (define (arbitrary-constant? pat)
        (if (pair? pat) (eq? (car pat) '?c) false))

      (define (arbitrary-expression? pat)
        (if (pair? pat) (eq? (car pat) '?) false))

      (define (arbitrary-variable? pat)
        (if (pair? pat) (eq? (car pat) '?v) false))

      (define (variable-name pat) (cadr pat))

      (define (skeleton-evaluation? pat)
        (if (pair? pat) (eq? (car pat) ':) false))
    #+END_SRC

    #+NAME: rule-env-fix
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none
      (define user-initial-environment (scheme-report-environment 5))
      (define (atom? x) (not (pair? x)))
    #+END_SRC


** Usage

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<rule-env-fix>>
     <<rule-deriv-rules>>
     <<rule-match>>
     <<rule-evaluate>>
     <<rule-instantiate>>
     <<rule-simplifier>>
     <<rule-dict>>
     <<rule-preds>>
     (define dsimp
       (simplifier deriv-rules))

     (dsimp '(dd (* x x) x))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (+ (* x 1) (* x 1))

   Excellent --- it works. Note that there is no algebraic
   simplification. Witness now the power of abstraction --- all we
   really have to do is define some rules for algebraic
   simplification, and pass the result of =dsimp= to =algsimp= to get
   a clean expression.

*** Algebraic Simplification
    Consider the rule set:

    #+NAME: rule-alg-rules
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define algebra-rules
        '(
          ( ((? op) (?c c1) (?c c2))                (: (op c1 c2))                )
          ( ((? op) (?  e ) (?c c ))                ((: op) (: c) (: e))          )
          ( (+ 0 (? e))                             (: e)                         )
          ( (* 1 (? e))                             (: e)                         )
          ( (* 0 (? e))                             0                             )
          ( (* (?c c1) (* (?c c2) (? e )))          (* (: (* c1 c2)) (: e))       )
          ( (* (?  e1) (* (?c c ) (? e2)))          (* (: c ) (* (: e1) (: e2)))  )
          ( (* (* (? e1) (? e2)) (? e3))            (* (: e1) (* (: e2) (: e3)))  )
          ( (+ (?c c1) (+ (?c c2) (? e )))          (+ (: (+ c1 c2)) (: e))       )
          ( (+ (?  e1) (+ (?c c ) (? e2)))          (+ (: c ) (+ (: e1) (: e2)))  )
          ( (+ (+ (? e1) (? e2)) (? e3))            (+ (: e1) (+ (: e2) (: e3)))  )
          ( (+ (* (?c c1) (? e)) (* (?c c2) (? e))) (* (: (+ c1 c2)) (: e))       )
          ( (* (? e1) (+ (? e2) (? e3)))            (+ (* (: e1) (: e2)))         )
          ))
    #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<rule-env-fix>>
     <<rule-deriv-rules>>
     <<rule-alg-rules>>

     <<rule-simplifier>>
     <<rule-dict>>
     <<rule-preds>>
     (define dsimp
       (simplifier deriv-rules))

     (define algsimp
       (simplifier algebra-rules))

     (define (derivative x)
       (algsimp (dsimp x)))

     (derivative '(dd (* x x) x))
     (derivative '(dd (+ (+ x (* x 5)) (* x x)) x))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (+ x x)
   : (+ 6 (+ x x))

   We now have a complete pattern matching and replacement language at
   our disposal, and we've tested it out on the rules of
   differentiation and algebraic simplification.

* Lecture 4B: Generic Operators

  We've seen that data abstraction separates the use of data objects
  from its representation. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient for
  complex systems.

  Consider a situation where there are multiple representation
  designers and they cannot agree on a single uniform representation.
  This makes the use complicated, since the user has to use different
  operators for different representations of the same object, creating
  clutter.

  One of the ways to solve such a problem is to enforce a standard for
  representations, but this is often impossible. Alternately, we could
  make a generic set of operators for the user that work on any kind
  of representation correctly and without complaint. Diagrammatically:

  #+LATEX: \begin{center}
  #+LATEX: \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  #+LATEX: \hline
  #+LATEX: \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Generic Operators}\\
  #+LATEX: \hline
  #+LATEX: &&&\\
  #+LATEX: &&&\\
  #+LATEX: &&&\\
  #+LATEX: R1 & R2 & R3 & $\dots$\\
  #+LATEX: &&&\\
  #+LATEX: &&&\\
  #+LATEX: &&&\\
  #+LATEX: \hline
  #+LATEX: \end{tabular}
  #+LATEX: \end{center}

  Moreover, note that it won't be too hard to add another
  representation R4, because all it needs to do is fit in the
  generic operators architecture.

  Throughout the rest of this lecture, we discuss the application of
  various generic operator techniques on an extended example: first
  representing complex numbers in rectangular and polar form, and then
  expanding this to include the entire real number system.

** Dispatch on Type

*** On Complex Numbers
    Complex numbers are represented in the complex plane as:

    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{tikzpicture}
    #+LATEX: \begin{scope}[every node/.style={fill=white,inner sep=2pt}]
    #+LATEX: \draw (0,-4)--(0,4) node[above] {$\Im$} (-4,0)--(4,0) node[right] {$\Re$};
    #+LATEX: \draw[dashed] (0,0) circle (3);
    #+LATEX: \coordinate (a) at (40:3);
    #+LATEX: \coordinate (b) at (3,0);
    #+LATEX: \coordinate (o) at (0,0);
    #+LATEX: \coordinate (h) at (2.3,0);
    #+LATEX: \coordinate (v) at (0,1.93);
    #+LATEX: \draw (a) node[above right] {$z=|z|e^{i\theta} = x+iy$};
    #+LATEX: \draw (b) node[below right] {$|z|$};
    #+LATEX: \draw (.1,1.5)--(0,1.5) node[left] {$i$};
    #+LATEX: \draw (1.5,.1)--(1.5,0) node[below] {$1$};
    #+LATEX: \draw (0,0)--(a);
    #+LATEX: \draw [dashed] (a)--(h) node[below right] {$x$};
    #+LATEX: \draw [dashed] (a)--(v) node[above left] {$y$};
    #+LATEX: \end{scope}
    #+LATEX: \pic[draw,"$\theta$",angle radius=0.8cm,angle eccentricity=1.3] {angle=b--o--a};
    #+LATEX: \fill[black] (a) circle (2pt) (b) circle (2pt) (h) circle (2pt) (v) circle (2pt);
    #+LATEX: \end{tikzpicture}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}

    It should be clear that for a complex number $z=|z|e^{i\theta}=x+iy$:
    $$|z|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$$
    $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}$$
    $$x=|z|\cos{\theta}$$
    $$y=|z|\sin{\theta}$$

    Let us say we want to add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex
    numbers. The most natural way to add is using rectangular form:

    $$\Re{(z_1+z_2)} = \Re{(z_1)} + \Re{(z_2)}$$
    $$\Im{(z_1+z_2)} = \Im{(z_1)} + \Im{(z_2)}$$

    However, the most natural way to multiply is using polar form:

    $$|z_1z_2|=|z_1||z_2|$$
    $$\theta{(z_1z_2)} = \theta{(z_1)}+\theta{(z_2)}$$

*** Arithmetic Implementation

    Let's implement the four basic arithmetic operations. As in the
    case of rational numbers, we assume the availability of the
    constructors and selectors:

    #+begin_example
    (make-rect x y)
    (make-pol magnitude theta)
    (real z)
    (img z)
    (mag z)
    (ang z)
    #+end_example

    Then,

    #+NAME: complex-arith
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (+c z1 z2)
        (make-rect
         (+ (real z1) (real z2))
         (+ (img z1) (img z2))))

      (define (-c z1 z2)
        (make-rect
         (- (real z1) (real z2))
         (- (img z1) (img z2))))

      (define (*c z1 z2)
        (make-pol
         (* (mag z1) (mag z2))
         (+ (ang z1) (ang z2))))

      (define (/c z1 z2)
        (make-pol
         (/ (mag z1) (mag z2))
         (- (ang z1) (ang z2))))
    #+END_SRC

*** George's Representation

    George loves the rectangular form of complex numbers. He therefore
    implements the constructors and selectors in the following way:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-rect x y)
        (cons x y))

      (define (real z)
        (car z))

      (define (img z)
        (cdr z))

      (define (make-pol r a)
        (cons
         (* r (cos a))
         (* r (sin a))))

      (define (mag z)
        (sqrt (+ (square (car z))
                 (square (cdr z)))))

      (define (ang z)
        (atan (cdr z) (car z)))
    #+END_SRC

*** Martha's Representation
    Martha, on the other hand, much prefers the polar representation.
    She implements the constructors and selectors as:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-pol r a)
        (cons r a))

      (define (mag z)
        (car z))

      (define (ang z)
        (cdr z))

      (define (real z)
        (* (car z)
           (cos (cdr z))))

      (define (img z)
        (* (car z)
           (sin (cdr z))))

      (define (make-rect x y)
        (cons
         (sqrt (square x) (square y))
         (atan y x)))
    #+END_SRC

    Naturally, George's representation is better if we want to use
    =+c= a lot, while Martha's is better if we want to use =*c= a lot.
    Often, it's impossible to choose between two equally good
    representations. The solution is to use generic selectors and
    constructors. Diagrammatically:

    #+LATEX: \begin{center}
    #+LATEX: \begin{tabular}[H]{|c|c|c|}
    #+LATEX: \hline
    #+LATEX: \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\texttt{+c -c *c /c}}\\
    #+LATEX: \hline
    #+LATEX: \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\texttt{make-rect make-pol mag real}}\\
    #+LATEX: \hline
    #+LATEX: &  &\\
    #+LATEX: &  &\\
    #+LATEX: &  &\\
    #+LATEX: Rectangular &  & Polar\\
    #+LATEX: &  &\\
    #+LATEX: &  &\\
    #+LATEX: &  &\\
    #+LATEX: \hline
    #+LATEX: \end{tabular}
    #+LATEX: \end{center}


*** Type Dispatch Manager

    One of our chief problems is that when we have a pair that's a
    complex number, we have no way of knowing whether it's rectangular
    or polar. By attaching this pair to a "type label", we can easily
    tell by reading the label which type it is, and accordingly call
    George's or Martha's procedures. Consider:

    #+NAME: type-arch
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (attach-type type contents)
        (cons type contents))

      (define (type datum)
        (car datum))

      (define (contents datum)
        (cdr datum))
    #+END_SRC

    Now, George redefines his procedures as:

    #+NAME: george-complex-procs
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-rect x y)
        (attach-type 'rectangular (cons x y)))

      (define (real-rectangular z)
        (car z))

      (define (img-rectangular z)
        (cdr z))

      (define (mag-rectangular z)
        (sqrt (+ (square (car z))
                 (square (cdr z)))))

      (define (ang-rectangular z)
        (atan (cdr z) (car z)))
    #+END_SRC

    Note that he changes his procedure names so that they don't
    conflict with the generic =make-rect=, =real=, and so on. The
    major change is that he rectangular complex numbers. Moreover,
    there's no need for George to have a =make-pol=, since that
    functionality is already provided by Martha, who implements her
    procedures as:

    #+NAME: martha-complex-procs
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-pol r a)
        (attach-type 'polar (cons r a)))

      (define (mag-polar z)
        (car z))

      (define (ang-polar z)
        (cdr z))

      (define (real-polar z)
        (* (car z)
           (cos (cdr z))))

      (define (img-polar z)
        (* (car z)
           (sin (cdr z))))
    #+END_SRC

    Now, we can implement the generic procedures as:

    #+NAME: complex-manager
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (real z)
        (cond ((rectangular? z)
               (real-rectangular (contents z)))
              ((polar? z)
               (real-polar (contents z)))))

      (define (img z)
        (cond ((rectangular? z)
               (img-rectangular (contents z)))
              ((polar? z)
               (img-polar (contents z)))))

      (define (mag z)
        (cond ((rectangular? z)
               (mag-rectangular (contents z)))
              ((polar? z)
               (mag-polar (contents z)))))

      (define (ang z)
        (cond ((rectangular? z)
               (ang-rectangular (contents z)))
              ((polar? z)
               (ang-polar (contents z)))))
    #+END_SRC

    We call procedures written this way "managers", since they decide
    whom to dispatch the data object to for processing. The predicates
    are simple label-checkers:

    #+NAME: complex-manager-preds
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (rectangular? z)
        (eq? 'rectangular (type z)))

      (define (polar? z)
        (eq? 'polar (type z)))
    #+END_SRC

    Note that complex numbers are now a pair of a label and a pair.

*** Review
    There are two major issues with this way of engineering the
    complex number system ("dispatch on type"):
    - George and Martha having to change their procedure names to
      prevent namespace violation. This issue, however, can be fixed
      by methods explored in later lectures.
    - A larger issue is that when an additional representation is
      added (say, Harry's), the manager's =cond= has to be changed.
      This isn't ideal, since it's a set of centralized procedures
      which all of George, Martha, and Harry have to be able to edit.
      This centralization and causes a bottleneck, and is annoying,
      especially because all the manager does, really, is a
      conditional dispatch --- it's a bureaucrat.

    Our next efforts will be directed at eliminating the manager
    procedures.

** Data-Directed Programming

   Abstractly, what does the manager do? It acts as a lookup table, of
   shape and form:

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
   | Generic | Polar        | Rectangular        |
   |---------+--------------+--------------------|
   | =real=  | =real-polar= | =real-rectangular= |
   | =img=   | =img-polar=  | =img-rectangular=  |
   | =mag=   | =mag-polar=  | =mag-rectangular=  |
   | =ang=   | =ang-polar=  | =ang-rectangular=  |

   We could decentralize the manager by simply constructing a globally
   accessible table like this, and letting George and Martha put their
   procedures into the correct place in the table. They must each set
   up their own columns, then they can continue to define their own
   "versions" of all the generic operators. They do this using two
   procedures:

   #+begin_example
   (put KEY1 KEY2 value)
   (get KEY1 KEY2)
   #+end_example

   =get= returns the value we'd =put= in the table. The precise way
   this table is represented is not of interest to us, and we defer
   its implementation to a later lecture.

   #+NAME: complex-ddp-tbl
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none
     (define (make-table)
       (let ((local-table (list '*table*)))
         (define (lookup key-1 key-2)
           (let ((subtable
                  (assoc key-1 (cdr local-table))))
             (if subtable
                 (let ((record
                        (assoc key-2 (cdr subtable))))
                   (if record (cdr record) false))
                 false)))
         (define (insert! key-1 key-2 value)
           (let ((subtable
                  (assoc key-1 (cdr local-table))))
             (if subtable
                 (let ((record
                        (assoc key-2 (cdr subtable))))
                   (if record
                       (set-cdr! record value)
                       (set-cdr! subtable
                                 (cons (cons key-2 value)
                                       (cdr subtable)))))
                 (set-cdr! local-table
                           (cons (list key-1 (cons key-2 value))
                                 (cdr local-table))))))
         (define (dispatch m)
           (cond ((eq? m 'lookup-proc) lookup)
                 ((eq? m 'insert-proc!) insert!)
                 (else (error "Unknown operation: TABLE" m))))
         dispatch))

     (define operation-table (make-table))
     (define get (operation-table 'lookup-proc))
     (define put (operation-table 'insert-proc!))
   #+END_SRC


*** Putting George's Procedures

    #+NAME: complex-george-puts
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (put 'rectangular 'real real-rectangular)
      (put 'rectangular 'img img-rectangular)
      (put 'rectangular 'mag mag-rectangular)
      (put 'rectangular 'ang ang-rectangular)
    #+END_SRC

    Note carefully that the value inserted into the table cell is
    actually a /lambda/, it's not a symbol. This means that the table
    literally contains within it the procedures, not their names.
    Technically, George could have given the third argument of =put=
    as a \lambda directly instead of first defining it. This is
    desirable, since George can safely debug and change his
    procedures, and only "commit" them when he puts them in the table.
    Moreover, it greatly simplifies lookups: to apply a procedure, one
    must only grab the correct cell of the table.


*** Putting Martha's Procedures
    Similarly:
    #+NAME: complex-martha-puts
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (put 'polar 'real real-polar)
      (put 'polar 'img img-polar)
      (put 'polar 'mag mag-polar)
      (put 'polar 'ang ang-polar)
    #+END_SRC

    Now, if Harry wants to add his procedures, he doesn't have to do
    anything except =put= them in the table.

*** Manager Automation

    The procedures hanging around in the table isn't enough: when =+c=
    calls (say) =real=, it needs to =get= these values from the table.
    This is done by:

    #+NAME: complex-operate
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (operate op object)
        (let ((proc (get (type object) op)))
          (if (not (null? proc))
              (proc (contents object))
              (error "Operation undefined."))))
    #+END_SRC

    It is now simple to define the generic operators:

    #+NAME: complex-tbl-gen-ops
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (real obj)
        (operate 'real obj))

      (define (img obj)
        (operate 'img obj))

      (define (mag obj)
        (operate 'mag obj))

      (define (ang obj)
        (operate 'ang obj))
    #+END_SRC


*** Usage

    The usage is the same as last time, since the difference is in the
    implementation:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<square>>
      <<type-arch>>
      <<george-complex-procs>>
      <<martha-complex-procs>>
      <<complex-ddp-tbl>>
      <<complex-george-puts>>
      <<complex-martha-puts>>
      <<complex-operate>>
      <<complex-tbl-gen-ops>>
      <<complex-arith>>
      (define a (make-rect 2 3))
      (define b (make-pol 5 (tan (/ 3 4))))

      (define result (+c a b))
      (real result)
      (img result)

      (car a)
      (car b)
      (car result)
      (cadr result)
      (cddr result)

    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 4.98276733430013
    : 7.012866684732013
    : rectangular
    : polar
    : rectangular
    : 4.98276733430013
    : 7.012866684732013

    #+begin_quote
    Note that an alternative to keeping the operations in a lookup
    table is to include the operations with the data object. This
    allows the data object to carry independently all the information
    required to work with it. This style of programming is called
    "message passing".
    #+end_quote

    We can see by the substitution rule how this system is working:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (real z)
      (operate 'real z)
      ((get 'polar 'real) (contents z))
      (real-polar (contents z))
    #+END_SRC

** Advanced Example: Semi-Complete Arithmetic System

*** Architecture
   Let us now embed our complex number system "package" in a more
   complex arithmetic system which, diagrammatically, looks like the
   following:

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{tabulary}{1.0\textwidth}{|C|C|C|C|}
   #+LATEX: \hline
   #+LATEX: \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\texttt{add sub mult div}}\\
   #+LATEX: \hline
   #+LATEX: \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\texttt{+complex -complex *complex /complex}}&&\\
   #+LATEX: \cline{1-2}
   #+LATEX: \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{}&&\\
   #+LATEX: \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Complex}& Rational & Lisp Numbers\\
   #+LATEX: \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\texttt{+c -c *c /c}}& \texttt{+rat *rat}& \texttt{+ - * /}\\
   #+LATEX: \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{}&&\\
   #+LATEX: \cline{1-2}
   #+LATEX: &&&\\
   #+LATEX: \makecell{~~~~~~Rectangular~~~~~~} & \makecell{~~~~~~~~Polar} & & \\
   #+LATEX: &&&\\
   #+LATEX: \hline
   #+LATEX: \end{tabulary}
   #+LATEX: \end{center}

   Our goal is to embed our complex number, rational number, and
   standard Lisp number code into a single system. This will also be
   done with tags and a lookup table, with data being tagged as
   =complex=, =rational=, or =number=. The top-level operations
   =add=, =sub=, =mul=, and =div= are defined in terms of an =operate=
   which is binary rather than unary. Later, we expand this system by
   adding a way to add polynomials.

*** Implementation

    The rational number procedures in this system are implemented thus:

    #+NAME: asn-rat-sel
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none
      (define (numer x) (car x))
      (define (denom x) (cdr x))
    #+END_SRC
    # frac-proc
    #+NAME: asn-rat
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-rat n d)
        (attach-type 'rational (cons n d)))

      (put 'rational 'add +rat)
      (put 'rational 'mul *rat)
    #+END_SRC

    The definitions of =+rat= and =*rat= are the same as last time:
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (+rat x y)
        (make-rat
         (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
            (* (numer y) (denom x)))
         (* (denom x) (denom y))))

      (define (*rat x y)
        (make-rat
         (* (numer x) (numer y))
         (* (denom x) (denom y))))
    #+END_SRC

    Similarly, we can implement constructors and =put= procedures for
    complex numbers and standard Lisp numbers in this system:

    #+NAME: asn-complex
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-complex z)
        (attach-type 'complex z))

      (define (+complex z1 z2)
        (make-complex (+c z1 z2)))

      (define (-complex z1 z2)
        (make-complex (-c z1 z2)))

      (define (*complex z1 z2)
        (make-complex (*c z1 z2)))

      (define (/complex z1 z2)
        (make-complex (/c z1 z2)))

      (put 'complex 'add +complex)
      (put 'complex 'sub -complex)
      (put 'complex 'mul *complex)
      (put 'complex 'div /complex)
    #+END_SRC

    Note that we define additional procedures =+complex=, =-complex=,
    and so on to add the =complex= tag to results of operating on
    complex numbers. Moving to standard numbers:

    #+NAME: asn-num
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-number n)
        (attach-type 'number n))

      (define (+number x y)
        (make-number (+ x y)))

      (define (-number x y)
        (make-number (- x y)))

      (define (*number x y)
        (make-number (* x y)))

      (define (/number x y)
        (make-number (/ x y)))

      (put 'number 'add +number)
      (put 'number 'sub -number)
      (put 'number 'mul *number)
      (put 'number 'div /number)
    #+END_SRC

    Finally, we must implement =add=, =sub=, =mul=, and =div=
    themselves:

    #+NAME: asn-toplevel
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (add x y)
        (operate-2 'add x y))

      (define (sub x y)
        (operate-2 'sub x y))

      (define (mul x y)
        (operate-2 'mul x y))

      (define (div x y)
        (operate-2 'div x y))
    #+END_SRC

    Finally, we implement the binary =operate=, =operate-2=:

    #+NAME: asn-operate-2
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (operate-2 op arg1 arg2)
        (if (eq? (type arg1) (type arg2))
            (let ((proc (get (type arg1) op)))
              (if (not (null? proc))
                  (proc (contents arg1)
                        (contents arg2))
                  (error "Operation undefined.")))
            (error "Argument type mismatch.")))
    #+END_SRC

*** Usage

    We're now ready to test this system:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export

      (define r (make-rat 2 4))
      (define s (make-rat 1 4))
      (add r s)

    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:

    : (number . 62)

    See from the output the structure: labels followed by actual value
    of the datum.

*** Adding Polynomials

    To do arithmetic on polynomials, we must first figure out how to
    represent them. Consider the polynomial:

    $$x^{15} + 2x^7 + 5$$

    One simple way to represent a polynomial is a list of
    coefficients, with the rightmost coefficient being the constant
    term, the second last being the linear term, followed by
    quadratic, and so on. However, for "sparse" polynomials like the
    one in the example, this will result in a list with a lot of
    zeros. We therefore choose a slightly different representation: a
    list of pairs. The =car= of the pair is the order, and the =cdr=
    is the coefficient. Thus, the polynomial in the example is
    represented as =((15 1) (7 2) (0 5))=. We call this the "term
    list" of the polynomial. In our final representation, we'll =cons=
    this with the last bit of missing information: the variable the
    polynomial is in.

    Thus, to construct a polynomial:

    #+NAME: asn-poly-cons
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-poly var term-list)
        (attach-type 'polynomial (cons var term-list)))

      (define (var poly) (car poly))
      (define (term-list poly) (cdr poly))
    #+END_SRC

    Now, implementing =+poly=:

    #+NAME: asn-+poly
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (+poly p1 p2)
        (if (eq? (var p1) (var p2))
            (make-poly
             (var p1)
             (+term (term-list p1)
                    (term-list p2)))
            (error "Polynomials not in same variable.")))

      (put 'polynomial 'add +poly)
    #+END_SRC

    Of course, this just pushed the real work onto =+term=, which is
    defined as:

    #+NAME: asn-+term
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (+term L1 L2)
        (cond ((empty-termlist? L1) L2)
              ((empty-termlist? L2) L1)
              (else
               (let ((t1 (first-term L1))
                     (t2 (first-term L2)))
                 (cond ((> (order t1) (order t2))
                        (adjoin-term
                         t1
                         (+term (rest-terms L1) L2)))
                       ((< (order t1) (order t2))
                        (adjoin-term
                         t2
                         (+term L1 (rest-terms L2))))
                       (else
                        (adjoin-term
                         (make-term (order t1)
                                    (add (coeff t1)
                                         (coeff t2)))
                         (+term (rest-terms L1) (rest-terms L2)))))))))
    #+END_SRC



    Clearly, we need to implement some predicates, constructors, and
    selectors for =term='s and =term-list='s:

    #+NAME: asn-tl-cons
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (empty-termlist? tl)
        (null? tl))

      (define (first-term tl)
        (car tl))

      (define (rest-terms tl)
        (cdr tl))

      (define (adjoin-term term tl)
        (cons term tl))

      (define (make-term o c)
        (cons o c))

      (define (order t)
        (car t))

      (define (coeff t)
        (cdr t))
    #+END_SRC

    Usage is obvious:


    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export

    :               (9 number . 4) (7 number . 6) (0 number . 20))

    Although somewhat hard to read, this is just the polynomial:

    $$x^{25} + 9x^{15} + 4x^9 + 6x^7 + 20$$

    which is the correct result of summing the polynomials:

    $$(x^{15}+2x^7+5) + (x^{25} + 8x^{15} + 4x^9 + 4x^7 + 15)$$

*** Recursive Data Directed Programming

    It's easy to miss one /very/ crucial point in the implementation
    of procedure =+term=: that when we actually add the coefficients
    of two same-order terms, we use the generic operator =add=. Or,
    instead of doing this:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (+ (coeff t1)
         (coeff t2))
    #+END_SRC

    we do:
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (add (coeff t1)
         (coeff t2))
    #+END_SRC

    What this does is that it lets our polynomial have any
    coefficients supported by the overall system. We therefore, "for
    free", have rational and complex coefficients. Therefore,
    expressions like the following are fully supported:

    $$\frac{3}{2}x^{2} + \frac{17}{7}$$ $$(3+2i)x^5+(4+7i)$$

    This works by calling =add= on the coefficients, which knows how
    to add fractions and complex numbers.

    :               (9 rational 4 . 13) (7 rational 252 . 119) (0 rational 65 . 4))




    Even cooler is the fact that we have support for polynomials with
    polynomial coefficients, such as:

    $$(x^2+1)y^2 + (x^3-2x)y + (x^4-7)$$

    This is because =add= also knows, recursively, how to add
    polynomials. We can, theoretically, nest this as far as we want
    to, having polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials whose
    coefficients are polynomials whose\dots

    Note that we could rewrite =+rat= to use =add= instead of =+=, and
    we'd be able to support expressions such as

    $$\frac{3x+7}{x^2+1}$$

    This exposes a powerful technique: once we have the basic
    implementation of any operation, say matrix addition, in the form:

    $$\begin{bmatrix}
    a & b\\
    c & d
    \end{bmatrix} +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    p & q\\
    r & s
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a+p & b+q\\
    c+r & d+s
    \end{bmatrix} $$

    If we use generic operators, it doesn't matter what $a$, $b$, and
    the other operands are: they can be any type the generic operators
    support, including matrices.

** Review

   We started our implementation of generic operators by writing a
   manager to dispatch the correct procedure according to type using
   conditional statements. We saw that this created a bottleneck at
   the manager. We then eliminated the manager by using a lookup
   table, which the generic operators accessed and got the correct
   \lambda, effectively decentralising the manager's role, since
   any new representation can be added to the table without any
   interaction with the others. Finally, we saw how to use generic
   operators to allow the recursive use of operations on types within
   the system.

   One feature, however, missing from the system, is the idea of "type
   coercion". Our system fails when it tries to add, say,

   $$3 + \frac{2}{5}$$

   by reporting a type mismatch (it cannot add a =number= and a
   =rational=). However, it won't complain if we ask it to add

   $$\frac{3}{1} + \frac{2}{5}$$

   Despite the meanings being mathematically the same. We then need to
   implement a way to "coerce" types into other types when it is
   mathematically meaningful to do so, for instance, interpreting a
   pure real number $r$ as complex number $r+0i$. The implementation
   of "type coercion" is shown in the SICP book.

   # and in appendix A

* Lecture 5A: Assignment, State, and Side-Effects

  Up until now, we've used no assignment statements in our use of
  Lisp. If we add one, there must be a good reason to do so, and the
  creation of significant advantage.
  We will first consider how we'd go about dealing with assignment in
  Lisp, then the benefits it brings to our programming practice.

** Functional v. Imperative Style

*** Functional Programming
    Functional programs encode mathematical truth in a procedure. For
    instance,

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (fact n)
        (cond ((= n 1) 1)
              (else (* n (fact (dec n))))))

      (fact 4)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 24

    This is almost precisely the mathematical definition of a factorial
    in Lisp:
    $$f(n) = \begin{cases} 1& n=1\\ n\times f(n-1) & n>1\end{cases}$$

    Moreover, such a function can be fully understood by substituting
    recursively:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (fact 4)
      (* 4 (fact 3))
      (* 4 (* 3 (fact 2)))
      (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (fact 1))))
      (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))
      (* 4 (* 3 2))
      (* 4 6)
      24
    #+END_SRC

    Furthermore, we can differentiate between procedures with different
    processes. Consider our Peano adders:

     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
       (define (pa+ x y)
         (if (= x 0)
             y
             (pa+ (dec x) (inc y))))
     #+END_SRC

     and

     #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
       (define (pb+ x y)
         (if (= x 0)
             y
             (inc (pb+ (dec x) y))))
     #+END_SRC



*** Imperative Programming

    Imperative programming involves writing statements which change
    the overall /state/ of the program. Lisp does this using
    assignment statements called =set!=.
    =set!= is called by giving it two arguments. The second is a
    value, and the first is the variable to assign it to. Or:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (set! <var> <value>)
    #+END_SRC

    Consider what this assignment does. It creates an instant in time.
    Before this instant, =<var>= had no value, or some other value.
    /After/ this =set!=, =<var>= has value =<value>=, which means that
    the =set!= changed something in the program state. Before the
    =set!= the state was (say) A, and after, it was a different state,
    (say) B. This is entirely different from any of our previous
    programs, all of which used functional programming style.

    It should be obvious that procedures which use assignment are not
    bijective, that is, for the same input, they may have different
    outputs. Consider:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define count 1)

      (define (demo x)
        (set! count (inc count))
        (+ x count))

      (demo 3)
      (demo 3)
      (demo 3)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 5
    : 6
    : 7

    =demo= does not compute any mathematical function.
    Instead, the successive values of =count= are =set!= and
    remembered somewhere in the environment each time =demo= is
    called.

    Clearly, assignment introduces difficulties. Even our previous
    substitution model is now insufficient, since it is a static
    phenomenon which cannot account for changing values in the
    environment. Symbols now can refer to some place where the values
    of variables are stored. While this certainly makes our job
    harder, assignment is worth the trouble, as we'll see later.

*** Direct Comparison

    Here's an iterative implementation of a functional factorial
    procedure:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (fact n)
        (define (iter m i)
          (cond ((> i n) m)
                (else
                 (iter (* i m) (inc i)))))
        (iter 1 1))

      (fact 4)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 24

    And an iterative implementation of an imperative-style factorial
    procedure:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (fact n)
        (let ((i 1) (m 1))
          (define (loop)
            (cond ((> i n) m)
                  (else
                   (set! m (* i m))
                   (set! i (inc i))
                   (loop))))
          (loop)))

      (fact 4)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 24

    Note the difference between the two. The first passes successive
    values of =i= and =m= as parameters into the next call of =iter=.
    However, in the imperative style, the very values of =i= and =m=
    are changed to their new values, and the procedure simply called
    again without any arguments.

    Note also that swapping the =set!= statements:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (set! i (inc i))
      (set! m (* i m))
    #+END_SRC

    Will mess up the execution of the program, since =m= depends on
    =i= having the correct value /at the time/ it's reassigned to =(*
    i m)=. The time instance creation inherent in assignment creates
    these time-based dependencies, which are worth being aware of.

** Environment Model

   As we observed, assignment invalidates our substitution model of
   evaluating Lisp programs. We therefore work on the creation of a
   new model which supports assignment.

*** Bound and Free Variables

    #+begin_quote
    We say that a variable =v= is "bound in an expression" =E= if the
    meaning of =E= is unchanged by the uniform replacement of =v= with
    a variable =w= (not occurring in =E=) for every occurrence of =v=
    in =E=.
    #+end_quote

    Bound variables exist naturally in mathematics. Consider the
    expressions:
    $$\forall x\exists y P(x,y)$$
    $$\int_0^1 \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{1+x^2}$$

    have no difference in meaning when $x$ is substituted:
    $$\forall w\exists y P(w,y)$$
    $$\int_0^1 \frac{\mathrm{d}w}{1+w^2}$$

    This is because, in both cases, $x$ is a bound variable. Now,

    #+begin_quote
    A quantifier is a symbol which binds a variable.
    #+end_quote

    Thus, in these cases, $\forall$, $\exists$, and $\int$ were the
    quantifiers of bound variable $x$. Similarly, consider a Lisp
    expression:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (lambda (y) ((lambda (x) (* x y)) 3))
    #+END_SRC

    Here, =x= and =y= are bound variables, and the \lambda are
    quantifiers for them. This can be illustrated by swapping out the
    variables and having no change in meaning:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (lambda (v) ((lambda (w) (* w v)) 3))
    #+END_SRC

    However, it is not necessary that all variables be bound. Consider
    the Lisp expression:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (lambda (x) (* x y))
    #+END_SRC

    =x= is bound, with quantifier \lambda. However, =y= is not bound
    (it is a free variable). This is because the definition of =y=
    does not come from the formal parameter list of a
    \lambda-expression or any other known location within the
    expression. Instead, it comes from somewhere outside. We cannot
    replace =y= with another variable =v=, since we don't know what
    value =y= may have.
    Formally,
    #+begin_quote
    We say that a variable =v= is "free in an expression" =E= if the
    meaning of =E= is changed by the uniform replacement of =v= with
    a variable =w= (not occurring in =E=) for every occurrence of =v=
    in =E=.
    #+end_quote

    In fact, in the expression:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (lambda (y) ((lambda (x) (* x y)) 3))
    #+END_SRC

    The symbol =*= is a free variable, since the expression's meaning
    will change if we replace it with the symbol =+=.

*** Scope

    Formally,

    #+begin_quote
    If =x= is a bound variable in =E=, then there is a
    \lambda-expression where it is bound. We call the list of formal
    parameters of this \lambda-expression the "bound variable list"
    and we say that the \lambda-expression "binds" the variable
    defined in the bound variable list. Moreover, those parts of the
    expression where a variable has a value defined by the
    \lambda-expression which binds it is called the "scope" of the
    variable.
    #+end_quote


    Or, for example:
    $$\mathtt{(\lambda~(y)~\underbrace{\mathtt{((\lambda~(x)~\overbrace{\mathtt{(*~x~y)}}^{\mathrm{Scope~of~}\mathtt{x}})~3)}}_{\mathrm{Scope~of~}\mathtt{y}})}$$

*** Frames and Environments

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 250pt
    [[./images/frames.pdf]]


    An environment is made up of a linked chain of frames. Shown in
    the figure are three frames, I, II, and III. Now, each of A, B, C,
    and D are different environments, which view the frames in
    different ways.

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
    | Environment | x | y | z | m |
    |-------------+---+---+---+---|
    | A           | 7 | 5 | 6 | - |
    | B           | 3 | 2 | - | 1 |
    | C           | 3 | 5 | - | - |
    | D           | 3 | 5 | - | - |

    Environments can be considered as different "vantage points" of
    the frame chain. From A, we see the values of the frame II and the
    frames behind II, in this case I. Therefore, we get the values of
    x, y, and z. However, there are two possible values of x. In this
    case, we say that the value of x in frame II "shadows" the value
    of x in all previous frames, and we consider that value to be the
    correct one. Note that this is actually making the choice to use
    the innermost scope's variables over ones in outer scopes. Other
    environments are similarly analyzed. Note that C and D are the
    same environment.

*** Procedure Objects

    A procedure objects consists of:
    A. A pointer to the procedure object.
    B. A pointer to the environment the procedure will execute in.
    C. The actual body (code) of the procedure.

    Diagrammatically:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 200pt
    [[./images/frameobj.pdf]]

*** Rules for Environment Model

    1. A procedure object is applied to a set of arguments by
       constructing a frame binding the formal parameters of the
       procedure to the actual arguments of the call, then evaluating
       the body of the procedure /in the context/ of the new
       environment thus constructed. The new frame has as its
       enclosing environment the environment part of the procedure
       being applied.

       For example, for a procedure =P=, evaluated at =(P 3 4)=, the
       actual arguments to =P= are "appended" to the environment =P=
       is called in. The procedure object itself has three pointers:

       - The first is to the procedure itself, =P=.
       - The second points to the extended environment.
       - The third point points to the actual \lambda.

       Diagrammatically:

       #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 300pt
       [[./images/rule1.pdf]]

    2. A \lambda-expression is evaluated relative to a given
       environment as follows: a new procedure object is formed, the
       combining the code of the \lambda-expression with a pointer to
       the environment of evaluation.

       This rule is self-explanatory.

    Our most important take-away is that an environment is a linked
    chain of frames, going all the way back to the first (global)
    frame. We now have a new working model, which works with
    assignment, as we'll soon see.


*** Assignment

    Let's play around with assignment in the environment model.
    Consider the following procedure:

    #+NAME: env-mod-make-counter
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define make-counter
        (lambda (n)
          (lambda ()
            (set! n (inc n))
            n)))
    #+END_SRC

    What does the environment look like once we define =make-counter=?
    Something like this:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth
    [[./images/make-counter.pdf]]

    Let us now use =make-counter= to define two counters, each of
    which start at different values of =n=:

    #+NAME: env-mod-make-counter-inc
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<env-mod-make-counter>>
      (define C1 (make-counter 0))
      (define C2 (make-counter 10))
    #+END_SRC

    The environment now looks like:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.95\textwidth
    [[./images/c1c2.pdf]]

    See that there is no /possible/ confusion between which =n= =C1=
    uses and which =n= =C2= uses. Moreover, neither =C1= nor =C2=
    would care about a globally defined =n=, or any =n= in a higher
    level frame, since it'd get shadowed by their own =n='s.

    We can now see how the following would work:

    The first call to =(C1)= sees that =n= is zero in its environment,
    and sets =n= to =0+1=1=, and returns =1=. The first call to =(C2)=
    sees that /its/ =n= is =10=, sets it to =11=, and returns =11=. The
    second call to =(C1)= sees that its =n= is =1=, then sets and
    returns =2=. The final call to =(C2)= sees that its =n= is =11=,
    which is then sets to =12= and returned.


*** Some Philosophy

    We have some questions to answer about sameness and change of
    objects. Consider that in the previous example, =C1='s =n= and
    =C2='s =n= are both called =n=, and yet refer to different
    objects. However, =C1= refers to only one object, =C1=. How then,
    can we tell if an identifier refers to an object? This issue is
    almost philosophical: if the only way know of an object is its
    identifier, what is an object anyway?

    We avoid these issues in Lisp's environment model by defining
    action, change, and identity as follows:

    #+begin_quote
    Action $A$ has an effect on object $X$ ($A$ changes $X$) if
    property $P$ true of $X$ before $A$ is false of $X$ after $A$.
    #+end_quote

    and

    #+begin_quote
    $X$ and $Y$ are the same object if any action which changes $X$
    changes $Y$.
    #+end_quote

    The (Lisp) world is thus made up of many individual objects, all
    with some local state.

** Advantages of Assignment

   We've seen that introducing assignment makes our pure functional
   programming somewhat "murky". One of the reasons to do this is that
   assignment often greatly enhances modularity, as we will show in an
   example. A word of caution, however: do not use assignment unless
   it is necessary.

*** Cesàro's Pi Finder
    Cesàro's theorem tells us that:

    $$P(\mathrm{gcd}(a,b)=1) = \frac{6}{\pi^{2}}$$

    Of course, we can estimate probabilities using the Monte Carlo
    method (do lots of tests, and divide the number of successful tests
    by the total number of tests conducted). Using assignment, the
    program looks like:

    #+NAME: c-mcarlo-1
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (estimate-pi n)
        (sqrt (/ 6 (monte-carlo n cesaro))))

      (define (cesaro)
        (= (gcd (random 4294967087) (random 4294967087)) 1))

      (define (monte-carlo trials experiment)
        (define (iter remaining passed)
          (cond ((= remaining 0)
                 (/ passed trials))
                ((experiment)
                 (iter (dec remaining)
                       (inc passed)))
                (else
                 (iter (dec remaining)
                       passed))))
        (iter trials 0))

      (estimate-pi 10000000)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS: c-mcarlo-1
    : 3.141330429791511

    Note that we use Racket's built in =random= to generate a random
    number. However, if we had to implement a PRNG on our own, it'd
    look something like:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define rand
        (let ((x random-init))
          (lambda ()
            (set! x (rand-update x))
            x)))
    #+END_SRC

    Assignment is used most naturally here because we want to give =x=
    the value of computing some function with input =x= to use the
    next time =rand= is called. This function is evaluated within a
    local scope where =x= at first has some constant seed value
    =random-init=.


*** Functional Cesàro's Pi Finder

    Since we can't use assignment to keep track of the "state" of the
    PRNG, we must write our program like:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (estimate-pi n)
        (sqrt (/ 6 (random-gcd-test n))))

      (define (random-gcd-test trials)
        (define (iter remaining passed x)
          (let ((x1 (rand-update x))
                (x2 (rand-update x1)))
            (cond ((= remaining 0)
                   (/ passed trials))
                  ((= (gcd x1 x2) 1)
                   (iter (dec remaining)
                         (inc passed)
                         x))
                  (else
                   (iter (dec remaining)
                         passed
                         x2)))))
        (iter trials 0 random-seed))
    #+END_SRC

    The state of the PRNG has "leaked" out into our program, that is,
    =iter= has to keep track of successive values of the seed. Worse
    still, this makes =monte-carlo= and =cesaro= non-general, reducing
    modularity. It is applications like these where assignment is
    incredibly useful, and helps keep our programs neat and modular.

* Lecture 5B: Computational Objects

  Now that we have local state, let's see what we can do with it. As
  we saw earlier, real world objects also have local state. As such,
  we can now make a model of the real world in our computer, taking
  advantage of its inherent modularity to built a model with modular
  objects.

  We explore this possibility in this lecture by writing a simulator
  for digital circuits in Lisp. Along the way, we'll have to implement
  certain data structures which support local state.

** Digital Circuit Language

   We build a language embedded in Lisp (in the same style as the
   picture language) to simulate digital circuits. Here's the expected
   usage:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define a (make-wire))
     (define b (make-wire))
     (define c (make-wire))
     (define d (make-wire))
     (define e (make-wire))
     (define s (make-wire))

     (or-gate a b d)
     (and-gate a b c)
     (inverter c e)
     (and-gate d e s)
   #+END_SRC

   The =or-gate= takes two input wires =a= and =b=, and returns the
   =OR= of the signals on wire =d=, very much like a real OR gate:

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{circuitikz}
   #+LATEX: \draw (0,0) node[or port] (or) {}
   #+LATEX: (or.in 1) node[left=0.04cm](a) {A}
   #+LATEX: (or.in 2) node[left=0.04cm](b) {B}
   #+LATEX: (or.out) node[right=0.04cm](d) {D}
   #+LATEX: ;
   #+LATEX: \end{circuitikz}
   #+LATEX: \end{center}

   We could use these primitives to
   write a half adder:

   #+NAME: dcl-g7
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (half-adder a b s c)
       (let ((d (make-wire))
             (e (make-wire)))
         (or-gate a b d)
         (and-gate a b c)
         (inverter c e)
         (and-gate d e s)
         'OK))
   #+END_SRC

   #+LATEX: \begin{center}
   #+LATEX: \begin{circuitikz}
   #+LATEX: \draw (0, 4)node[xor port] (xorone){}
   #+LATEX: (0, 2)node[and port] (and){}
   #+LATEX: (xorone.in 1) node[left=0.5cm](a) {A}
   #+LATEX: (xorone.in 2) node[left=0.5cm](b) {B}
   #+LATEX: (xorone.out) node[right=0.04cm](s) {S}
   #+LATEX: (and.out) node[right=0.04cm](c) {C}
   #+LATEX:
   #+LATEX: (a.east) to[short,-*] (xorone.in 1) |- (and.in 1)
   #+LATEX: (b.east) to[short,-*] ($(b.east)!.5!(xorone.in 2)$) coordinate (branch)
   #+LATEX: -- (xorone.in 2)
   #+LATEX: (branch) |- (and.in 2);
   #+LATEX: \end{circuitikz}
   #+LATEX: \end{center}

   Note carefully that the procedure =half-adder= doesn't actually
   return anything: it merely makes calls to the gate procedures.
   We'll see why later. Since the language is hierarchical, we could
   now write a full adder:

   #+NAME: dcl-g8
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (full-adder a b c-in sum c-out)
       (let ((s (make-wire))
             (c1 (make-wire))
             (c2 (make-wire)))
         (half-adder b c-in s c1)
         (half-adder a s sum c2)
         (or-gate c1 c2 c-out)))
   #+END_SRC

** Gates

   Let us now implement the primitive gates of this language. Here's
   an =inverter=:

   #+NAME: dcl-g1
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (inverter in out)
       (define (invert-in)
         (let ((new
                (logical-not (get-signal in))))
           (after-delay inverter-delay
                        (lambda ()
                          (set-signal! out new)))))
       (add-action! in invert-in))
   #+END_SRC

   =inverter= defines a procedure called =invert-in=, and adds that
   action to the wire =in=. =invert-in= itself takes the logical not
   of =in= and sets the signal on =out= to this value, after some
   delay. See that this is precisely how a digital inverter in the
   real world is expected to work: wires have certain signals
   (=get-signal= and =set-signal=), these signals change according to
   how the wires are routed =add-action!=, and there are certain
   delays before the signal changes.

   Of course, the primitive =logical-not= is easy to define:

   #+NAME: dcl-g2
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (logical-not s)
       (cond ((= s 0) 1)
             ((= s 1) 0)
             (else
              (error "Invalid signal" s))))
   #+END_SRC

   Similarly, =and-gate= can be defined as:

   #+NAME: dcl-g3
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (and-gate a1 a2 out)
       (define (and-action-proc)
         (let ((new-value
                (logical-and (get-signal a1)
                             (get-signal a2))))
           (after-delay and-gate-delay
                        (lambda ()
                          (set-signal! out new-value)))))
       (add-action! a1 and-action-proc)
       (add-action! a2 and-action-proc))
   #+END_SRC

   The only difference is in that we need to =get-signal= two signals
   and =add-action!='s to two signals. =logical-and= can be
   implemented as:

   #+NAME: dcl-g4
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (logical-and a b)
       (cond ((= a 0)
              (cond ((= b 0) 0)
                    ((= b 1) 0)))
             ((= a 1)
              (cond ((= b 0) 0)
                    ((= b 1) 1)))))
   #+END_SRC

   Finally, an =or-gate= is implemented as:

   #+NAME: dcl-g5
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (or-gate r1 r2 out)
       (define (or-action-proc)
         (let ((new-value
                (logical-or (get-signal r1)
                             (get-signal r2))))
           (after-delay or-gate-delay
                        (lambda ()
                          (set-signal! out new-value)))))
       (add-action! r1 or-action-proc)
       (add-action! r2 or-action-proc))
   #+END_SRC

   =logical-or= is defined similar to =logical-and=:

   #+NAME: dcl-g6
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (logical-or a b)
       (cond ((= a 0)
              (cond ((= b 0) 0)
                    ((= b 1) 1)))
             ((= a 1)
              (cond ((= b 0) 1)
                    ((= b 1) 1)))))
   #+END_SRC

** Wires

   We define wires as:

   #+NAME: dcl-w1
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (make-wire)
       (let ((signal 0)
             (action-procs '()))
         (define (set-my-signal! new)
           (cond ((= signal new) 'DONE)
                 (else
                  (set! signal new)
                  (call-each action-procs))))
         (define (accept-action-proc proc)
           (set! action-procs
                 (cons proc action-procs))
           (proc))
       (define (dispatch m)
         (cond ((eq? m 'get-signal) signal)
               ((eq? m 'set-signal!) set-my-signal!)
               ((eq? m 'add-action!) accept-action-proc)
               (else
                (error "Bad message" m))))
       dispatch))
   #+END_SRC

   Clearly, a wire is defined by two local-scope variables, =signal=
   and =action-procs=, which are initially set to =0= and ='()= (the
   empty list, =nil=) respectively. Internally defined procedure
   =set-my-signal!= does the obvious thing and sets the signal to the
   new signal. It then calls all the action procedures of this wire.
   =accept-action-proc= adds a new procedure to the front of the
   existing action procedure list (=action-procs=) a new procedure.
   It then calls this procedure for reasons we'll see later. Finally,
   =dispatch= does the right thing according to its argument.

   =call-each= is a simple =cdr= down a list and execution --- note the
   extra parenthesis around =((car procs))=:

   #+NAME: dcl-w2
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (call-each procs)
       (cond ((null? procs) 'DONE)
             (else
              ((car procs))
              (call-each (cdr procs)))))
   #+END_SRC

   Naturally, we can now define =get-signal=, =set-signal=, and
   =add-action= using the wire's =dispatch=:

   #+NAME: dcl-w3
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (get-signal wire)
       (wire 'get-signal))

     (define (set-signal! wire new-val)
       ((wire 'set-signal!) new-val))

     (define (add-action! wire proc)
       ((wire 'add-action!) proc))
   #+END_SRC

** Delays and Propagation

   We define the =after-delay= procedure as:

   #+NAME: dcl-w4
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (after-delay delay action)
       (add-to-agenda!
        (+ delay (current-time the-agenda))
        action
        the-agenda))
   #+END_SRC

   =after-delay= calls a function called =add-to-agenda!=. This
   function takes three arguments to add to a data structure called
   an agenda: the time at which to add an action, the action, and the
   agenda object to add to.

   To "run" the agenda, we define =propagate=:

   #+NAME: dcl-w5
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (propagate)
       (cond ((empty-agenda? the-agenda) 'DONE)
             (else
              ((first-agenda-item the-agenda))
              (remove-first-item! the-agenda)
              (propagate))))
   #+END_SRC

   =propagate= simply executes the first item off the agenda, removes it,
   then executes the rest of the agenda until there's nothing else
   left in the agenda.

** The Agenda

   We've the use of the agenda. We need the following primitives:

   #+begin_example
   (make-agenda)
   (current-time agenda)
   (empty-agenda? agenda)
   (add-to-agenda! time action agenda)
   (first-agenda-item agenda)
   (remove-first-item! agenda)
   #+end_example

   Here's a data structure which can do the job:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
    [[./images/the_agenda.pdf]]

    In essence, the agenda is a sorted list. The =car= of the agenda is the
    current time. The =cdr= of this agenda is a list of pairs, each of
    which we'll call a "time segment". The =cdr= of each time segment
    is a queue of actions to execute, and the =car= is the time at
    which all these actions are scheduled.

*** Time Segments

    These are trivial to implement, since they're just pairs:

    #+NAME: dcl-a1
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-time-segment time q)
        (cons time q))

      (define (segment-time s) (car s))

      (define (segment-queue s) (cdr s))
    #+END_SRC

*** Agenda Implementation

    The constructors, selectors, and mutators are:

    #+NAME: dcl-a2
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (make-agenda) (list 0))

      (define (current-time agenda) (car agenda))

      (define (set-current-time! agenda time)
        (set-car! agenda time))

      (define (segments agenda) (cdr agenda))

      (define (set-segments! agenda segments)
        (set-cdr! agenda segments))

      (define (first-segment agenda)
        (car (segments agenda)))

      (define (rest-segments agenda)
        (cdr (segments agenda)))
    #+END_SRC

    There's only one predicate:

    #+NAME: dcl-a3
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (empty-agenda? agenda)
        (null? (segments agenda)))
    #+END_SRC

    =add-to-agenda= is defined as:

    #+NAME: dcl-a4
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (add-to-agenda! time action agenda)
        (define (belongs-before? segments)
          (or (null? segments)
              (< time (segment-time (car segments)))))
        (define (make-new-time-segment time action)
          (let ((q (make-queue)))
            (insert-queue! q action)
            (make-time-segment time q)))
        (define (add-to-segments! segments)
          (if (= (segment-time (car segments)) time)
              (insert-queue! (segment-queue (car segments))
                             action)
              (let ((rest (cdr segments)))
                (if (belongs-before? rest)
                    (set-cdr!
                     segments
                     (cons (make-new-time-segment time action)
                           (cdr segments)))
                    (add-to-segments! rest)))))
        (let ((segments (segments agenda)))
          (if (belongs-before? segments)
              (set-segments!
               agenda
               (cons (make-new-time-segment time action)
                     segments))
              (add-to-segments! segments))))
    #+END_SRC

    This procedure wants to add an action $A$ at time $t$ to the
    agenda. Several cases present themselves:

    1. $t$ is less than the earliest time in the agenda. In this case,
       a new time segment must be created, and the =cdr= of the agenda
       must point to it. The =cdr= of this new time segment should be
       the rest of the segments.
    2. $t$ is equal to one of the times in the agenda. In this case,
       $A$ must be inserted into the action queue of the correct time
       segment.
    3. $t$ is any other value. In this case, a new time segment must
       be created and placed in the correct place. The =cdr= of the
       previous segment must be the new segment, and the =cdr= of the
       new segment must be the rest of the segments.

    This procedure does exactly this. We first define some helper
    functions: =belongs-before?= simply compares the required time of
    $A$ with the first segment of a list of input segments, or an
    empty list. =make-new-time-segment= simply creates a queue,
    inserts $A$ into it, and creates a time segment ready for
    insertion. =add-to-segments!= is a recursively written procedure.
    The base cases are:
    1. If $t$ is equal to the =car= of the segments, add it to the
       action queue of this segment.
    2. If $t$ is less than the =car= of the segments, put the segment
       before it.
    Finally, the actual function checks if $t$ is less than the
    earliest time in the agenda, in which case =set-segments!= is
    called. Otherwise, =add-to-segments!= is called to do the right
    thing. In essence, this procedure is an insertion sort.

    We now define how to remove the first time of the agenda:

    #+NAME: dcl-a5
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (remove-first-item! agenda)
        (let ((q (segment-queue (first-segment agenda))))
          (delete-queue! q)
          (if (empty-queue? q)
              (set-segments! agenda (rest-segments agenda)))))
    #+END_SRC


    =delete-queue!= (albeit poorly named) is a procedure which deletes
    the first element of a queue. If this causes the entire queue to
    be empty, we get rid of the time segment.

    Finally, a procedure for getting the first agenda item and setting
    the time counter to its time is:

    #+NAME: dcl-a6
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
      (define (first-agenda-item agenda)
        (if (empty-agenda? agenda)
            (error "Agenda is empty --- FIRST-AGENDA-ITEM")
            (let ((first-seg (first-segment agenda)))
              (set-current-time! agenda (segment-time first-seg))
              (front-queue (segment-queue first-seg)))))
    #+END_SRC

** Queues

   Our only missing piece now is implementing the action queues time
   segments use. These are FIFO (first in, first out) buffers, and
   thus the following constructors, selectors, and mutators are
   required:

   #+begin_example
   (make-queue)
   (empty-queue? q)
   (front-queue q)
   (insert-queue! q item)
   (delete-queue! q)
   #+end_example

   It is natural to represent a queue as a standard list, since it's
   just a bunch of items. However, this will cause the
   =insert-queue!= mutator to run in $O(n)$ time. This is because
   linked lists by default store only a pointer to the first element,
   and there's no way to get a pointer to the last element without
   traversing the list. We avoid this problem by implementing a
   structure which looks like this:

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
   [[./images/q.pdf]]

   The =rear-ptr= always points to the last element of the queue,
   giving us an $O(1)$ way to insert elements to the end of the
   queue. Queues are thus a pair of "pointers".

   We initialize an empty queue as a pair of empty lists. An empty
   queue is thus one with the =front-ptr= equal to =null=. Thus:

   #+NAME: dcl-q1
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (make-queue) (cons '() '()))

     (define (empty-queue? queue)
       (null? (front-ptr queue)))

     (define (front-ptr queue) (car queue))

     (define (rear-ptr queue) (cdr queue))

     (define (set-front-ptr! queue item)
       (set-car! queue item))

     (define (set-rear-ptr! queue item)
       (set-cdr! queue item))

     (define (front-queue queue)
       (if (empty-queue? queue)
           (error "FRONT: empty queue" queue)
           (car (front-ptr queue))))
   #+END_SRC

   Now, the core implementation of a queue: the insertion of an item.

   #+NAME: dcl-q2
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (insert-queue! queue item)
       (let ((new-pair (cons item '())))
         (cond ((empty-queue? queue)
                (set-front-ptr! queue new-pair)
                (set-rear-ptr! queue new-pair)
                queue)
               (else
                (set-cdr! (rear-ptr queue) new-pair)
                (set-rear-ptr! queue new-pair)
                queue))))
   #+END_SRC

   First, create a new queue item object. Then, two cases present themselves:
   1. If the queue was empty, set both the =front-ptr= and =rear-ptr=
      to the new item, and return the queue.
   2. Otherwise, go to the last item of the queue. Set its =cdr= to
      the new item, and set the =rear-ptr= to the new item. Return the
      queue.


   Finally, we must implement deletion of the first item.

   #+NAME: dcl-q3
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (delete-queue! queue)
       (cond ((empty-queue? queue)
              (error "DELETE-QUEUE!: called with empty queue" queue))
             (else
              (set-front-ptr! queue (cdr (front-ptr queue)))
              queue)))
   #+END_SRC

   Which simply makes =front-ptr= point to the second element of the
   queue, and returns the queue. If the queue is empty, it throws an
   error since you can't delete the first element of an empty queue.

** Using the Digital Circuit Language

   Before using our (now complete) circuit language, we define a
   procedure called =probe=, which shows the simulator in action. That
   is, it adds an action to a wire which prints some wire information
   whenever the signal changes. Consider:

   #+NAME: dcl-p
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (probe name wire)
       (add-action! wire
                    (lambda ()
                      (display name)
                      (display ": TIME = ")
                      (display (current-time the-agenda))
                      (display ": NEW-VAL = ")
                      (display (get-signal wire))
                      (newline))))
   #+END_SRC

** Church's =set-car!= and =set-cdr!=

   Although =set-car!= and =set-cdr!= are primitives for efficiency
   reasons, it is theoretically possible to define them in terms of
   =set!=. That is, once we have one way to do assignment, it is
   unnecessary to define more primitives, similar to how =cons=,
   =car=, and =cdr= could be implemented by \lambda-expressions.
   Consider:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (cons x y)
       (lambda (m)
         (m x y)))

     (define (car x)
       (x (lambda (a d) a)))

     (define (cdr x)
       (x (lambda (a d) d)))

     (define a (cons 1 2))
     (car a)
     (cdr a)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1
   : 2

   =cons= defines a pair as a \lambda which takes as an argument a
   procedure =m=, which it applies to arguments =x= and =y=. =car=
   takes as an input a pair (a \lambda which takes a \lambda
   argument), and gives it as an argument a \lambda which takes two
   argument and returns the first. =cdr= does the same thing, except
   its \lambda argument returns the second argument. Since these are
   purely functional, we can apply the substitution rule to see what
   really goes on:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define a (cons 1 2))
     (define a (lambda (m) (m 1 2)))

     (car a)
     (car (lambda (m) (m 1 2)))
     ((lambda (a d) a) 1 2)
     1
   #+END_SRC

   We can also define =cons=, =car=, and =cdr= such that they support
   =set-car!= and =set-cdr!=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both
     (define (cons x y)
       (lambda (m)
         (m x
            y
            (lambda (n) (set! x n))
            (lambda (n) (set! y n)))))

     (define (car x)
       (x (lambda (a d sa sd) a)))

     (define (cdr x)
       (x (lambda (a d sa sd) d)))

     (define (set-car! x n)
       (x (lambda (a d sa sd) (sa n))))

     (define (set-cdr! x n)
       (x (lambda (a d sa sd) (sd n))))

     (define a (cons 1 2))
     (car a) (cdr a)
     (set-car! a 10)
     (set-cdr! a 20)
     (car a) (cdr a)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1
   : 2
   : 10
   : 20

   All we need to do is add two arguments to =m=: \lambda's which set
   =x= and =y= to the argument. =car= and =cdr= are nearly identical to their
   previous forms, with the only difference being the number of
   arguments the \lambda passed to the pair (=m=) takes. =set-car!=
   and =set-cdr!= need only call the =set!= \lambda's in =m= with the
   value they are to be set to.

   Thus, once we have a single assignment procedure (=set!=), we can
   create any other forms of assignment functionally. Note, however,
   that this is not necessarily how =set-car!= and =set-cdr!= are
   /actually/ implemented, since this way is less efficient.

* Lecture 6A: Streams, Part I

  In the last lecture, we discussed assignment. We also saw that this
  one addition required a complete change of perspective from our
  simple substitution model to an environment based model, which was
  required since assignment introduces the ideas of state and of time.
  Pairs and variables are actually /objects/ with identity instead of
  mere mathematical variables. Two pairs with the same =car= and =cdr=
  may still be different objects. In this sense, assignment causes the
  programming language to be philosophically harder, and can create
  state-related bugs. Why did we choose to incur this cost? To build
  modular systems, such as the psuedorandom number generator we built.
  Assignment often helps modularity, since state is a part of the real
  world, as in the case of digital circuits.

  In this lecture, we will attempt to shift our perspective of the
  world in order to remove state, by looking at it from a "signal
  processing" style system: with signals coming in, being processed,
  and some output being generated.

** Stream Processing

   Consider the following two problems:

   1. Given a tree that looks like:
      #+LATEX: \begin{center}
      #+LATEX: \begin{forest}
      #+LATEX: for tree={%
      #+LATEX: calign=fixed edge angles,
      #+LATEX: delay={where content={}{shape=coordinate}{}},
      #+LATEX: parent anchor=south,
      #+LATEX: s sep=1.5cm,
      #+LATEX: }
      #+LATEX: [  [[1] [[2] [7]]] [[13] [[12] [14]]]]
      #+LATEX: \end{forest}
      #+LATEX: \end{center}
      We want to sum all the squares of all the odd nodes. A
      conventional solution to this problem is as follows:

      #+NAME: str-1-tree
      #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none :noweb strip-export
        <<atom?>>

        (define (make-tree left right)
          (list left right))

        (define (left-branch tree)
          (car tree))

        (define (right-branch tree)
          (cadr tree))

        (define (leaf-node? node)
          (atom? node))
      #+END_SRC

      #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
        <<square>>
        <<str-1-tree>>

        (define (sum-odd-squares tree)
          (if (leaf-node? tree)
              (if (odd? tree)
                  (square tree)
                  0)
              (+ (sum-odd-squares
                  (left-branch tree))
                 (sum-odd-squares
                  (right-branch tree)))))

        (define my-tree (make-tree (make-tree 1 (make-tree 2 7)) (make-tree 13 (make-tree 12 14))))
        (sum-odd-squares my-tree)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : 219

   2. Given an input $k$, we want returned a list of all the odd Fibonacci
      numbers till the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ Fibonacci number.

      #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
        <<iter-fib>>
        (define (odd-fibs n)
          (define (next k)
            (if (> k n)
                '()
                (let ((f (fib k)))
                  (if (odd? f)
                      (cons f (next (inc k)))
                      (next (inc k))))))
          (next 1))

        (odd-fibs 10)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : (1 1 3 5 13 21 55)


   Now, we can see that these procedures are actually doing the
   following:

   1. Square odd nodes in a tree:
      1. Enumerate the leaves.
      2. Filter for =odd?=-ness.
      3. Map =square=.
      4. Accumulate using =+= starting at 0.
   2. Find odd Fibonacci numbers till the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ one:
      1. Enumerate numbers from 1 to $n$.
      2. Map =fib=.
      3. Filter for =odd?=-ness.
      4. Accumulate using =cons=, starting with the empty list ='()=.

   We've rewritten the procedures in terms of enumerating, mapping,
   filtering, and accumulating. Note that this is similar to how
   signals are processed by passing them through filters and the like.
   However, our Lisp procedures in their
   current state do not explicitly have these distinct parts.

   Let us therefore invent a language for writing procedures in this
   signal processing way. The objects passed between maps, filters,
   etc. are called "streams", which are defined by the following
   selectors and constructors:
   - Constructor: =(cons-stream x y)=.
   - Selectors:
     - =(head s)=
     - =(tail s)=

   #+NAME: str-1-macros
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none :noweb strip-export
     (define-syntax cons-stream
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((cons-stream a e) (cons a (delay e)))))

     (define-syntax delay
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((delay expr)
          (memo-proc (lambda () expr)))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+NAME: str-1-seqs
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports none :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-macros>>
     (define (head s)
       (car s))

     (define (tail s)
       (force (cdr s)))

     (define (force p)
       (p))

     (define (empty-stream? s)
       (null? s))

     (define (memo-proc proc)
       (let ((already-run? false) (result false))
         (lambda ()
           (if (not already-run?)
               (begin
                (set! result (proc))
                (set! already-run? true)
                result)
               result))))
   #+END_SRC

   The behavior is such that for any =x= and =y=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-seqs>>

     (define x 1)
     (define y 2)
     (head (cons-stream x y))
     (tail (cons-stream x y))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1
   : 2

   We also have =the-empty-stream=. Note that this description makes a
   stream look a lot like a pair, and, for now, it's alright to
   pretend streams /are/ pairs. We can now define our stream
   processing procedures:

   #+NAME: str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export

     (define (map-stream proc s)
       (if (empty-stream? s)
           the-empty-stream
           (cons-stream
            (proc (head s))
            (map-stream proc (tail s)))))

     (define (filter-stream pred s)
       (cond
         ((empty-stream? s) the-empty-stream)
         ((pred (head s))
          (cons-stream (head s)
                       (filter-stream pred (tail s))))
         (else (filter-stream pred (tail s)))))

     (define (accumulate-stream combiner init-val s)
       (if (empty-stream? s)
           init-val
           (combiner (head s)
                     (accumulate-stream combiner init-val (tail s)))))

     (define (enumerate-tree tree)
       (if (leaf-node? tree)
           (cons-stream tree the-empty-stream)
           (append-streams
            (enumerate-tree
             (left-branch tree))
            (enumerate-tree
             (right-branch tree)))))

     (define (append-streams s1 s2)
       (if (empty-stream? s1)
           s2
           (cons-stream (head s1)
                        (append-streams (tail s1) s2))))

     (define (enumerate-interval low high)
       (if (> low high)
           the-empty-stream
           (cons-stream low
                        (enumerate-interval (inc low) high))))

     (define (singleton s)
       (cons-stream s the-empty-stream))
   #+END_SRC

   These should be relatively intuitive. We can now write our
   procedures using stream processing:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>

                                                    (enumerate-interval 1 n)))))

     (define my-tree (make-tree (make-tree 1 (make-tree 2 7)) (make-tree 13 (make-tree 12 14))))
     (sum-odd-squares my-tree)

   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   This brings modularity into our programs: we're establishing
   conventional interfaces via streams. This way of looking at
   programs (mapping, filtering, etc.) is very general and can be used
   to write all sorts of procedures.


** Some More Complex Examples

*** Flattening

    Suppose we have a "stream of streams", or a data structure that
    looks like the following:
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      ((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9))
    #+END_SRC

    That we want to process into a single stream:
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 98)
    #+END_SRC

    That is, we want to "flatten" the stream of streams. We can do so
    like this:

    #+NAME: str-1-flatten
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>
      (define (flatten stream-of-streams)
        (accumulate-stream append-streams
                           the-empty-stream
                           stream-of-streams))
    #+END_SRC

    Now, consider a function $f$ that returns a stream. We want to
    call $f$ on a stream (map $f$ to it), then take its output
    stream-of-streams and flatten it. This is also simple:

    #+NAME: str-1-flatmap
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      <<str-1-flatten>>
      (define (flatmap f s)
        (flatten (map-stream f s)))
    #+END_SRC

*** Prime Sum Pairs

    Our first problem is: given $N$, find all pairs $i$, $j$ ($0< j <
    i \leq N$) such that $i+j$ is prime. For instance, given $N=6$,
    our expected output is something like:

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t :align ccc
    |      $i$ |      $j$ |    $i+j$ |
    |----------+----------+----------|
    |        2 |        1 |        3 |
    |        3 |        2 |        5 |
    |        4 |        1 |        5 |
    | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |

    We can therefore write:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-flatmap>>

     (#%require math/number-theory) ;; for prime?
     (define (prime-sum-pairs n)
       (map-stream (lambda (p)
                     (list (car p) (cadr p) (+ (car p) (cadr p))))
                   (filter-stream (lambda (p)
                                    (prime? (+ (car p) (cadr p))))
                                  (flatmap (lambda (i)
                                             (map-stream (lambda (j) (list i j))
                                                         (enumerate-interval 1 (dec i))))
                                           (enumerate-interval 1 n)))))

     (head (prime-sum-pairs 6))
     (head (tail (prime-sum-pairs 6)))
     (head (tail (tail (prime-sum-pairs 6))))
#+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (2 1 3)
   : (3 2 5)
   : (4 1 5)

   How does this work? Let's read it inside out, starting with the
   =flatmap=. The first argument to =flatmap= is a function which,
   given an input =i=, creates a stream of lists of =i= and =j= for
   all values of =j= between =1= and =i=. The second argument is
   simply all =i='s from =1= to =n=. =flatmap= therefore creates a
   stream that looks like the following:

   $$\left[
   \binom{2}{1}~\binom{3}{1}~\binom{3}{2}~\binom{4}{1}~\binom{4}{2}~\binom{4}{3}~\binom{5}{1}~\cdots
   \right]$$

   All that's left to do is filter this stream for the =prime?=-ness
   of $i+j$ in each list, then create our output in the expected
   format. This is done using =filter-stream= with the right
   $\lambda$, and then mapping this stream to our output format.

*** TODO Backtracking: The Eight Queens Problem


** The Catch: On Efficiency

   By treating streams the way we have, simply as lists, introduces a
   form of inefficiency. Consider the problem of finding the second
   prime in the interval $[10^4, 10^{15}]$. =enumerate-interval= would
   never terminate, since it'll spend forever generating an incredibly
   long list of numbers. Assuming this can be done, we'll spend
   forever and a day filtering and checking primality, only to ignore
   most of this work and pick up the second element of the list.
   This is clearly outrageous, since most of the work has gone to
   waste, assuming a computer could do it in the first place. It seems
   the "traditional" approach, while less mathematically pretty, is
   better, since it would stop as soon as it found the second prime.

   Now, this would indeed be true if streams were lists. But ---
   streams are streams, so we can indeed do:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>
     (#%require math/number-theory)
     (define (get-prime low high)
       (filter-stream prime?
                      (enumerate-interval low high)))
     (head (tail (get-prime 10000 1000000000000000)))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 10009

   And get a result. It seems that we can have our cake and eat it
   too. What is this magic? How are we able to both have the
   expressiveness of stream-style processing /and/ the efficiency of
   traditional programming? What is this magical black box called a
   stream?

** Implementing Streams

   Streams work on the principle of "laziness". That is, when we
   declare a stream, it figures out /only/ what the first element is, and
   promises to do the rest of the work "later". If, and /only if/ we
   need the second element is it computed, by us calling on the
   promise. An alternate way to visualize this is by imagining how
   you'd thread a string through a series of tubes: we only pull out
   of the far end as much string as we need.[fn:8]

   Streams are an on-demand data structure. These are easy to
   implement in our language using procedures as first-class citizens.
   Here's how =cons-stream=, =head=, and =tail= are defined:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (define-syntax cons-stream
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((cons-stream a e) (cons a (delay e)))))

     (define (head s)
       (car s))

     (define (tail s)
       (force (cdr s)))
   #+END_SRC

   =define-syntax= defines =cons-stream= to be a macro. All that this
   means is that any instances of =(cons-stream a e)= are replaced by
   =(cons a (delay e))= /before/ we pass the program to the
   interpreter. Why we define it as a macro rather than a procedure
   will become clear momentarily. Note that by this token, streams are
   created as the =cons= of the first input and the second input
   passed to something called =delay=. =head= is the same as =car=,
   and =tail= calls =force= on the =cdr= of the stream.

   Clearly, there's some magic going on in =delay= and =force= which
   makes streams lazy: but there's really none. Here's how they're
   defined:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (define-syntax delay
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((delay expr)
          (lambda () expr))))

     (define (force p)
       (p))
   #+END_SRC

   Again =delay= is simply a macro that replaces any instance of
   =(delay expr)= with =(lambda () expr)=. That is, it hides the
   expression inside a \lambda. =force= calls this \lambda, recovering
   the expression.

   Simply doing this creates the behavior we need. Consider our
   previous example, that of finding primes (=get-prime=). Here's what
   happens:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (define (get-prime low high)
       (filter-stream prime?
                      (enumerate-interval low high)))
     (head (tail (get-prime 10000 1000000000000000)))
   #+END_SRC

   We can use the substitution model since everything is purely
   functional:
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (enumerate-interval 10000 1000000000000000)
   #+END_SRC

   How is =enumerate-interval= defined?

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (define (enumerate-interval 10000 1000000000000000)
       (if (> 10000 1000000000000000)
           the-empty-stream
           (cons-stream 10000
                        (enumerate-interval (inc 10000) 1000000000000000))))
   #+END_SRC

   It does a =cons-stream= on =10000= and a /promise/ to compute
   =(enumerate-interval 10001 1000000000000000)=. Or, explicitly
   written:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (cons 10000 (delay (enumerate-interval (inc 10000) 1000000000000000)))
   #+END_SRC

   Expanding out the =delay= and checking its output:
   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>
     (cons 10000 (lambda () (enumerate-interval (inc 10000) 1000000000000000)))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (10000 . #<procedure:...CDEkB/ob-p1kSJ7.rkt:91:12>)

   So our "stream" really is just a pair of the first element and some
   procedure that delay created. Calling =head= would just give us:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>
     (head (cons 10000 (lambda () (enumerate-interval (inc 10000) 1000000000000000))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 10000

   What would =tail= give us? It'll simply call the \lambda, giving us
   another pair:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>
     (tail (cons 10000 (lambda () (enumerate-interval (inc 10000) 1000000000000000))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (10001 . #<procedure:...CDEkB/ob-zfZJq9.rkt:25:4>)

   Clearly, =enumerate-interval= was only called the second time
   /when/ we called tail, and not before. This is where the efficiency
   is created.

   Note that we're filtering the stream for =prime?=-ness. How does
   =filter-stream= work? Here's the definition:

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     (define (filter-stream pred s)
       (cond
         ((empty-stream? s) the-empty-stream)
         ((pred (head s))
          (cons-stream (head s)
                       (filter-stream pred (tail s))))
         (else (filter-stream pred (tail s)))))
   #+END_SRC

   Since it also uses =cons-stream=, the output it generates is also a
   promise-style pair. =filter-stream= will keep "tugging" on the
   stream (keep calling on promises, as in the =else= clause), until
   it finds a prime.

   #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
     <<str-1-map-filter-accum-append-enum-enum-tree>>
     (#%require math/number-theory)
     (filter-stream prime? (cons 10000 (lambda () (enumerate-interval (inc 10000) 1000000000000000))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (10007 . #<procedure:...CDEkB/ob-Mvek4B.rkt:25:4>)

   Since we want to find the second prime, when we call =tail= on the
   stream, the =delay= is =force='d, and we get the prime =10009=.

   Note that we define =delay= and =cons-stream= as macros because we
   /don't/ want their arguments evaluated: i.e., we want them to be
   lazy. This is only possible if we define them as macros and
   directly substitute the source before compilation.

*** A Small Optimization

    Often, calling =tail= repeatedly will result in the recomputation
    of certain procedures that may already have been computed. This
    can get expensive, so we add memoization by slightly changing
    =delay=:
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      (define-syntax delay
        (syntax-rules ()
          ((delay expr)
           (memo-proc (lambda () expr)))))
    #+END_SRC

    =memo-proc= itself just remembers if it has already computed a
    procedure by using a flag (=already-run?=) and storing the value
    in =result=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang sicp :eval no-export :exports both :noweb strip-export
      (define (memo-proc proc)
        (let ((already-run? false) (result false))
          (lambda ()
            (if (not already-run?)
                (begin
                  (set! result (proc))
                  (set! already-run? true)
                  result)
                result))))
    #+END_SRC

    Streams, clearly, make life simpler and bring more modularity into
    our code.



* Footnotes
[fn:8] This is indeed how the video lectures explain it, see Lecture
6A at timestamp 47:39.

[fn:1] =let= is a Lisp primitive which takes as its first argument a
series of definitions, and second input a series of applications that may
use these definitions. The trick is that these definitions are only
valid in the body (second argument) of =let=, effectively creating a
local namespace.

[fn:2] For an operation defined on members of a set, the result of
that operation is a member of the set. For instance, addition on
natural numbers.

[fn:3] Note that Lisp actually implements pairs using "real" data
structures, since using procedures this way is less efficient.

[fn:4] $p \otimes p = p$

[fn:5] LISP actually stands for LISt Processing.

[fn:6] We use "initiate" and "substitute" interchangeably to mean
swapping out expressions in the skeleton provided by the RHS of the
rules.

[fn:7] "Garbage in, garbage out" means that the simplifier will
produce garbage output if the rules supplied to it are garbage. That
is, it makes no attempt to fix flaws in logic on the part of the user,
much like a computer. This underlying principle of computing was noted
by the father of computers, Charles Babbage: "On two occasions I have
been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong
figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly
to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a
question."
