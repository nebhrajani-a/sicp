* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

** Notes
   My notes are based on the 1986 presentation of 6.001 (SICP),
   produced by Hewlett-Packard. The notes are generated using Emacs'
   Org mode, are written in literate programming style, and use
   Racket's =#lang sicp=. In some (very few) cases, this causes the
   code in these notes to differ from the equivalent code in
   MIT-Scheme. These instances are pointed out in the notes.

   The notes are compiled together into a single PDF file, which is
   good enough for me. However, if you're interested in having it
   organised as HTML with each lecture being a node, open an issue and
   I'll find somewhere to host an HTML version.

** Videos
